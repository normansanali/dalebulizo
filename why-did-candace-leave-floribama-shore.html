Source: FacebookThe cast of MTV's hit southern party show Floribama Shore is back for their third season – and it looks like it's going to be another wild one.
We're picking up right where we left off with these party animals, this time, with the whole crew plus a newcomer."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But why did she leave in the first place?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><p>The cast of MTV's hit southern party show <a href=#>Floribama Shore</a> is back for their third season – and it looks like it's going to be another wild one.</p><p>We're picking up right where we left off with these party animals, this time, with the whole crew <a href=#>plus a newcomer</a>. When we last saw everyone at the end of Season 2, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Candace Rice was leaving the house early</a>. We thought this might be a careful way of announcing her early departure from the show, but it looks like she's back for this season.</p><p>But while it seems like things are going well for the group, why did Candace have to leave early in the first place?</p><p>Luckily, it doesn't have anything to do with any in-house drama.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Candace left to attend her brother's graduation.</h2><p>To announce to her housemates that she was going to have the leave a little early, Candace sat everyone down in the living room to give the announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>"My little brother's graduating, and I need to be there for his graduation," she told the house. "So I got to leave the beach house early."</p><p>Her Floribama friends are not happy about this, as she's met with a round of "no!"s. "</p><p>"I'm going to miss you," Aimee tells her, and Candace promises she'll miss everyone too.</p><p>Candace then goes to pack up all of her stuff to prepare to go home, much to the sadness of the rest of the house.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does this mean for Candace and Codi Butts?</h2><p>Before this announcement, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Candace and Codi</a> went on a date, and Codi was wondering if he had some feelings for Candace that he needed to address.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's tough, because Candace is the first one to leave, and I don't know — is it more than a friendship?" Codi asks. "Is it going to be like dating? And I don't know because she's not going to be here."</p><p>Codi is feeling the pressure to act fast — or not act at all.</p><p>"When it comes to pursuing a relationship with Candace, I don't know. It's like, time is running out," he says.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: MTV</a></figure><p>Before she leaves, though, it doesn't look like Codi gets a chance to make that final move. In this third season, some of the members of the cast are <a href=#>coupled off</a> in outside relationships, and it looks like Codi isn't trying to pursue Candace anymore. Looks like those feelings died when she left the house last season.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mattie Lynn Breaux isn't Candace's replacement.</h2><p>While <a href=#>newcomer Mattie Lynn Breax</a> was added to the cast this season, it looks like she's not meant to be anyone's replacement. Mattie is a reality-TV veteran, appearing on other party shows like Party Down South.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Since Candace is back, it looks like they're just adding to the team. It'll be interesting to see who Mattie makes a connection with this season — and if she and Candace actually get along.</p><p>Watch Floribama Shore Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on MTV.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2abkaOxoq%2FEZqOemaaaeqe4zqugm5mdlnq0tM6rnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
