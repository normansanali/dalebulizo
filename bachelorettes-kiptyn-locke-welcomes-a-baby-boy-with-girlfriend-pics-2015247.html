To put you first, support you and be someone you can count on – no matter the situation, time or place – I’ll be there for you. I promise to live my life in a way that gives you an example of a good man and positive role model. I will teach you to respect, appreciate and love a woman. To open doors, take your first bite second, and be a source of strength, security and caring. I will share with you the importance of passion in all aspects of life: sport, relationships, work, your personal interests and beyond as you show up to each and every day. And when you find your passion I will support you, encourage you and stand behind you no matter where you find it. Your happiness will always be enough to make me happy. You will never be alone in this world. I promise to show you how looking out for those around you, whether best friends or strangers, makes our world a better place. I’ll teach you to never underestimate the value of humor, never compromise your principles, and always remember the importance of family, friends, loyalty, integrity and character. I promise to introduce you to many of this big world’s greatest treasures and then encourage you as you forge your own path and become your own man. Above all else, I promise you love, unconditional love each and every day until I take my last breath. Welcome to the world, son.

"I promise to live my life in a way that gives you an example of a good man and positive role model. I will teach you to respect, appreciate, and love a woman. To open doors, take your first bite second, and be a source of strength, security, and caring."</p><p>The proud first-time dad went on to stress the "importance of passion in all aspects of life," writing, "And when you find your passion I will support you, encourage you and stand behind you no matter where you find it. Your happiness will always be enough to make me happy. You will never be alone in this world."</p><p>He continued: "I promise to show you how looking out for those around you, whether best friends or strangers, makes our world a better place.

Welcome to the world, son."</p><p>On Thursday, July 23, the Bachelor Pad alum — who previously dated fellow Bachelor Nation star Tenley Molzahn — followed up with a second post about his baby boy, including a photo collage of Koltyn's first days.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Little man is just cruising through his first week of life," Locke wrote. "Eating, sleeping, smiling, and flexing…Countless hours in my arms or sleeping in my lap and I'm freaking myself out on how long I can just stare at him. So many unknowns in this experience and journey. I'm feeling beyond lucky that he is healthy and loves his Dad and his Mom so much. Can't wait for the adventures ahead."</p><p>Us exclusively broke the news of Murphy's pregnancy back in March. "I've always looked forward to being a dad. It's something I've been so excited about," he told Us at the time.</p><p>Of Murphy, 29 — whom he met at a charity event, and who has her own medical distribution company — he added, "Samm is an amazing woman. She's an athlete, active, intelligent woman running her own business. She'll be an amazing mom."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270Z6rrZ2jYriqvNOypWakn5i4pnnWnqOcp52awG6tjJuYm7Fdl7y6edaiq6Fll56%2FrbLRopynnF2ltqS%2FjGtnam1iaYRw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
