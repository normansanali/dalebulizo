Speaking on the&nbsp;<a href=#>"Call Her Daddy"</a> podcast, <a href=#>Kenney, who played Debbie Gallagher on "Shameless,"</a> indicated she had a sisterly relationship with Rossum in real life, which included both the good and the bad.&nbsp;"There were times when she would try to be a good influence and then there were times where she would be blatantly giving me bad ... not the best advice," Kenney said (via <a href=#>E! News</a>).</p><p>"The Conners" star also said Rossum had a hard time leaving her personal life at the door when she went to work. As a consequence, the atmosphere on set became lighter after Rossum left. "I remember, pre her leaving I'd go to set some days and I'd be very anxious about having a scene with her because if she had a bad day, she made it a bad day for everyone," Kenney said (via E! News). However, Kenney said she has "a lot of love" for Rossum, even though they haven't spoken in a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>In her farewell <a href=#>Facebook</a> post, Rossum seemed to have nothing but affection for her co-stars. "I taught Emma to shave her legs. I was there when Ethan learned to drive. Shanola and Jeremy and Joan and Bill danced at my wedding," Rossum wrote. Sounds like the complicated relationship between the Gallagher sisters sometimes reflected what was going on behind the scenes.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2tian9ye9KhmKadnJrAtHnSrZirZZOhrqq50macpqWpYr%2Bwv9KupGalkZmybrHVnqmyp56aeq610p6pmpqcmnqwuoysnK1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
