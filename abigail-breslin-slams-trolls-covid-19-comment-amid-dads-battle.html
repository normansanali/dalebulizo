Shame,” she captioned the pic.</p><p>She received support from fellow stars including <a href=#><strong>Debra Messing</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Sarah Hyland</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Emma Kenney</strong></a>.</p><p>“Oh Abbie! I am praying for him and for all of you. I can’t imagine how scary it is and painful not being able to visit him. I’m sending you and him all love and healing,” the Will and Grace <a href=#>alum, 52, wrote</a>.</p><p>Hyland, 30, simply commented three white hearts. Similarly, the <a href=#>Shameless</a> actress, 21, responded with a single red heart emoji.</p><p>Fans <a href=#>shared their own experiences with COVID-19</a> and stories of caring for loved ones through their battles as they wished Breslin and her dad well.</p><p>Breslin shared her father’s favorite poem on Instagram — “If” by Rudyard Kipling — revealing to fans that he “always reads [it] to me when I’m scared.” She did not offer a further update on his condition, however.</p><p>The same day, the New York native gushed about her father on social media. “Plz keep praying for my daddy. I wish I could talk to him rn on the phone,” <a href=#>she wrote in a tweet</a>, adding, “Hopefully I’ll have some good news shortly. Just missing hearing his voice.”</p><p>In a separate Instagram post, Breslin wrote, “This is me saying that if you asked my dada: a mask is FAR LESS uncomfortable than a ventilator. So stfu. And wear your damn mask. Please. No one should go thru this.”</p><p>Haters again flocked to the post, with one person calling masks “pointless.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Little Miss Sunshine star continues to update fans on her father’s condition, despite the hate she’s been receiving. On Wednesday, February 10, she tweeted, “All I can say is this: Covid is never more real until you’ve experienced it firsthand or through a loved one.”</p><p>She continued: “It’s unpredictable and relentless. My dad has been incredible [sic] careful and hasn’t left home since it began except for doctors appointments. Plz be safe.
