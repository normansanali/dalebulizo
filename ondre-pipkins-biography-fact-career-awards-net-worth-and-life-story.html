His father, Al Pipkins, was an assistant coach at Saginaw High School. When he was six, Pipkins moved to Atlanta, Georgia. He later returned to Michigan, spending his freshman high school season at Rochester Adams High School, before attending Park Hill High School in Kansas City, Missouri, for his remaining three years.</p><p>At Park Hill, Pipkins was an All-American defensive lineman. Regarded as a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Pipkins was listed as the No. 3 defensive tackle available in his class. In January 2012, he was rated by Rivals as 14th in its ranking of the Top 100 recruits in the country.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=college-career></span><span id=College_career>College career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As a true freshman in 2012, Pipkins appeared in 12 games as a reserve defensive tackle. He made his career debut against Alabama, which featured All-American interior linemen Barrett Jones and Chance Warmack, registering one tackle.</p><p>Pipkins arrived in camp for the 2013 season, he had lost more than 30 pounds from 347 pounds as a freshman to 315 pounds in August 2013. Pipkins said he was in the best shape of his life and added, “The biggest difference has been my weight, and the way my body’s come together. I came in at 30 percent body fat, now I’m down to 24 percent, my weight’s at 315 and I’m running to the ball.” Through the first two games of the 2013 season, Pipkins registered two tackles before tearing his ACL and sitting out the rest of the season. In 2015, Pipkins, citing pressure to medically retire at Michigan, transferred to continue his career at Texas Tech.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fpLulvsRmp6Kom567tHnBoqagqpGltbp5xZqarWWTlr%2BmsdFmmLCZopnAbrrErWSwp6KptW6tzZ1kpaGWmnq0wM6rsGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
