She posed for photos in very little clothing. She said she <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>"hoped"</a> the photos would get her fired from the show, but producers held her to her contract. When the pics were taken, she was 17 years old. In a truly gross ironic twist, her TV dad and admitted sex offender Collins compared Biel's photos to "child pornography" in the New York Daily News, adding that, "As a parent of a young daughter, this is very disturbing to me."&nbsp;</p><p>Biel later told <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>Entertainment Weekly</a> that she regretted the whole affair, explaining it was a moment of wild rebellion that stemmed from the show's producers not allowing her to dye and cut her hair. She also said that the pictures turned out racier than she anticipated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG1jZ4JwsMCromarlZi%2FpsDSZpqaq6RihLW0jKGcmq6Vo3q1vsiem2agmZmycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
