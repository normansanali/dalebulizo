Bush's staff members. On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, the Tennessee native describes herself as "Mother of the Year (just ask the kiddos)."</p><p>And when it comes to her professional career, the mother of two has been working as the senior vice president of communications of Airlines for America. Between her time as George W. Bush's associate director of communications from 2006 to 2007 until now, she worked in the wholesale beer industry as a senior vice president of communications and public affairs.</p><p>Before that, she worked as a television producer on WJLA-TV and KTRK-TV.

The controversial decision to invite him received widespread backlash from many, including DWTS host Tom Bergeron, who expressed disappointment that producers decided to inject politics into the show.</p><p>But for Sean, the backlash is "nothing new," he said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>. "Look, I'm used to that, you've got to zone it out, enjoy yourself. I know who I am and what I believe and I'm comfortable with that. I did this to have some fun, enjoy myself, and hopefully show what a great opportunity this show is for the country to bring people together, allow you to root for another person regardless of their background," he said. "And we're missing a lot of that right now."</p><p>"Tonight, you can be for everybody," he continued. "You can cheer everybody on regardless of what they believe or where they're from or what they think on a particular policy, that's good. And if people in America can look tonight and say for two hours we tuned out everything else that's going on, relaxed, had fun and laughed at Sean Spicer wearing a lime green shirt, then God bless it."</p><p>According to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> page, Sean is even auctioning off that famous lime green ruffled shirt "to support @YRFund (caregivers of injured service members) & @IndyFund (tracked chairs for injured warriors," he wrote. "Great #Halloween costume potential."</p><p>Even <a href=#>Queer Eye's beloved Karamo Brown</a> spoke up regarding Sean Spicer's appearance on DWTS telling Variety, "I want people to know that as a country we always have to reach out to those that are different from us and try to figure out how to have conversations."</p><p>Tune in to Dancing with the Stars Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKydkaN6tLzInJyrZZ2Wv7O1xJ1krac%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
