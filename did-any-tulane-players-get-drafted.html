As the NFL draft approaches, many fans of the Green Wave are eager to know which players from the program will be selected by professional teams. So, did any Tulane players get drafted this year? Let's take a look.</p><p>First and foremost, it's important to note that the NFL draft is a highly competitive and unpredictable process. While many talented college players are selected each year, there are also many who are overlooked or passed over for a variety of reasons. That being said, Tulane has a strong track record of producing NFL talent, and this year was no exception.</p><p>The 2021 NFL draft saw two Tulane players selected by professional teams: defensive end Patrick Johnson and cornerback Cameron Sample. Johnson was selected in the seventh round by the Philadelphia Eagles, while Sample was selected in the fourth round by the Cincinnati Bengals.</p><p>Both players had impressive college careers and were highly regarded by NFL scouts and analysts. Johnson was a dominant pass rusher for the Green Wave, recording 21.5 sacks and 35 tackles for loss over his four-year career. He was also a two-time first-team All-American Athletic Conference selection and was named the conference's Defensive Player of the Year in 2020.</p><p>Sample, meanwhile, was a versatile defensive player who excelled as both a pass rusher and in coverage. He recorded 10.5 sacks and 22 tackles for loss over his college career and was named the Defensive MVP of the 2020 Armed Forces Bowl, in which he recorded three sacks and a forced fumble.</p><p>While two players may not seem like a large number, it's important to remember that the NFL draft is a highly selective process, and being selected at all is a significant accomplishment. The fact that Tulane had two players selected this year speaks to the program's commitment to excellence both on and off the field.</p><p>In addition to their success on the field, both Johnson and Sample are also known for their dedication to academic achievement and community service. Johnson was a three-time All-AAC Academic Team selection and was named to the Dean's List multiple times. Sample, meanwhile, was named to the 2020 Allstate AFCA Good Works Team for his community service efforts.</p><p>It's worth noting that Tulane has a long history of producing NFL talent, with dozens of players from the program going on to successful careers in the league. Some of the most notable Tulane alumni include Pro Football Hall of Famers Jerry Rice and Rickey Jackson, as well as current NFL players like Matt Forte and Cairo Santos.</p><p>In conclusion, while only two Tulane players were selected in the 2021 NFL draft, their success is a testament to the program's commitment to excellence both on and off the field. Patrick Johnson and Cameron Sample are both highly talented players who have bright futures ahead of them in the NFL, and Tulane fans can be proud of their accomplishments. As the program continues to build on its rich history of producing NFL talent, it's clear that the Green Wave will continue to be a force to be reckoned with in college football and beyond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6doJ1lkaPGbsDUpZinnV2luaLFxKuqZp%2BVqXqlvsCfq56c</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
