As a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">first-time mom</a>, she has to look at the world completely differently than most others her age, particularly when it comes to finances. With her baby daddy behind bars, it's more important than ever for Rock to keep her bank account stacked so she and Junior can live their best lives. Many are curious to see what's next for the Baltimore native, especially now that she's moving on from working with Zeus.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lately, Rock's been expressing interest in launching her own network to ensure the money she brings in for sharing her life matches her emotional and physical output. "Just letting y'all know I'm in my elevating era so popping off like I use to ain’t me no more," the entertainer wrote on her Instagram Story earlier this month. "I'm into movies or something serious in the film production world. More likely to be on&nbsp;'BMF'&nbsp;[than] a crouchy type 'Bad Girls Club' type of show again," she added. Interestingly, "Sexy Can I" hitmaker <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ray J</a> thinks that Chrisean would be the perfect fit for his "ratchet" Tronix platform, and he wants to give her plenty of creative freedom.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ray-j-wants-to-eat-alongside-chrisean-rock>Ray J Wants to Eat Alongside Chrisean Rock</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"If somebody can find Chrisean and tell her let’s work something out, whatever she wants to do," the L&HH star said on Instagram Live recently. "We’re different from other networks. She might be looking into her own [network]. Okay, cool! Look, it’s all good. I mean I got some powerhouse partners like Young Rich Mula and Stunna Girl. We locked in and they already got they network. We already helped create a whole streaming platform called Redrum TV." Rather than having people fight for clout and money, Ray wants to help creators all have their own network so they can partner. "That's the big play, that's where everybody eats," he insisted.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As Ray J continues to set his sights on securing the bag with stars like Chrisean Rock, his ex, Princess Love looks to be moving on for real this time after announcing their separation on social media (again). This time, the rumour mill is linking the 39-year-old to actor John Boyega after they were spotted on a night out together. See how Ray reacted to those allegations at the link below, and let us know what kind of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">show you'd like to see Rock on</a> next in the comments.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
