In a bombshell <a href=#>41-minute video</a> titled "No More Lies," the star claimed he wasn't erasing the sentiment of his first apology, however, his answer to "BYE SISTER" was essentially a point-by-point rebuttal of Westbrook's video and Star's public and private claims. Plus, Charles kept the receipts (i.e. text message screenshots) like a good social media star.</p><p>In the video, Charles denied that his SugarBearHair post was premeditated, and slammed Westbrook's sexual manipulation allegations. He claimed that on the night of Westbrook's birthday dinner, the waiter he allegedly hit on, named Sam Cooke, was the one who initiated their conversation. Cooke even told Charles he was bisexual, and the star invited him back to his hotel room but said he "didn't have to do anything." Charles also accused Cooke of pretending to be "fully gay" in order to get him on the phone and "illegally record the conversation" for a video, which was then taken out of context.</p><p>"I am a 19-year-old virgin. ... I have never and will never use my fame, money, or power to manipulate or get any sexual actions from a guy," he said. "That is disgusting. It is not me, and the fact that Tati brought this up blows my mind."</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Newsweek</a>,&nbsp;Westbrook lost around 200,000 subscribers after Charles posted "No More Lies."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam1lZoJye9aeZJ%2Bhnpa5rcWMrqWdnaKowaK6w2aroZ1dmb%2BiucBmmZ6sp5qyr3nJmqSeq12YtaK%2By56qZpmemXq1rdOiZLCdo6mvs7vOpGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
