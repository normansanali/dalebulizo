At the time, the Oscar winner was married to <strong>Grace Hightower</strong>, with whom he welcomed <a href=#>son Elliot and daughter Helen</a> in 1998 and 2011, respectively.</p><p>De Niro and the socialite tied the knot in 1997, two years before he <a href=#>filed for divorce and sued Hightower</a> for custody of their son. The pair later reconciled and <a href=#>renewed their vows</a> in 2004, but they called it quits for good in 2018.</p><p>“Grace and I have two beautiful children together. We are entering a period of transition in our relationship, which is a difficult but constructive process,” the Meet the Parents actor <a href=#>noted in a statement to Us Weekly</a> at the time.</p><p>Three years later, De Niro was photographed holding hands with Chen on a romantic European getaway. The duo were caught <a href=#>packing on the PDA</a> while on a yacht with friends.</p><p>Over the years, the Taxi Driver star and the competitive martial artist have remained tight-lipped about their relationship. The pair were spotted meeting up with De Niro’s pals <a href=#><strong>Billy Crystal</strong></a> and <strong>Harvey Keitel</strong> at Giorgio Baldi in Los Angeles in April 2023, one month before the Godfather Part II actor <a href=#>announced the arrival of his seventh child</a>.</p><p>The New York native told ET Canada in May 2023 that he “just had” baby No. 7, but he did not <a href=#>immediately reveal the identity</a> of the child’s mother. His About My Father costar <a href=#><strong>Kim Cattrall</strong></a> hinted later that month that De Niro welcomed the newborn with Chen.</p><p>“God bless him. His significant other, Tiffany, is such a beautiful woman,” the Sex and the City alum gushed to Extra. “She came to the set once with her family and watched filming, and she was gorgeous and sweet. I’m happy for both of them.”</p><p>De Niro first became a father in 1976, welcoming son Raphael with his then-wife, <strong>Diahnne Abbott</strong>. He also adopted Abbott’s daughter from a previous relationship, Drena, before the couple’s 1988 split.</p><p>The Golden Globe winner went on to <a href=#>welcome twin sons Julian and Aaron</a> via surrogate with model <strong>Toukie Smith</strong>, whom he dated from 1988 to 1996. While fans were <a href=#>shocked to hear De Niro’s family expanded</a> even further in 2023 — at 79 years old — he assured Page Six the pregnancy was “planned.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“How you could not plan that kind of thing?” he teased while promoting About My Father.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Chen:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwaqyxZqlsmWTnbKveZRmq6GhnpzAbsDOZqKnp6dirqO71K1kq6eSmr%2B1ecOeZKehoqTAbrPIq6Ofqpmau6V7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
