We’ve been riding the Weezy F. Baby train since Tha Block Is Hot,&nbsp;and, personally, I would have watched this movie as often as I rewatch The Summer I Turned Pretty — and the number of times I’ve rewatched Conrad ask Belly if she memorizes every single thing that he’s ever said is astronomical.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@buydusty href=#>@buydusty</a><p>Disney out here taking some risks in 2024!

We’d love to see an animated project featuring Wayne, and as some other TikTokers said; there are certainly platforms in which it could exist. Here’s hoping he sees the excitement from his fan base and gets his creative ideas flowing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopahllJ7Ar7HYZqCsZZ6kwW65wKSgp59dlnqou86nZK2nXZZ6qLvBpaCnZZ2kw6qxjLCgraBdobatedaasKedXZfCtXnFmqWsZaOWxm7AwKScZqWpYrqwusSyZJqmqayuuns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
