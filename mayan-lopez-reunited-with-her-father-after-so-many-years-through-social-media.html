Mayan described how her father’s adultery impacted her family in a funny video, and viewers took note. Even more so, the TikTok video piqued the interest of producer Debbie Wolfe, who thought that the narrative belonged on TV.&nbsp;Mayan Lopez is the daughter of comedian George Lopez, widely known for his stand-up specials on race and culture, particularly Mexican American culture. Following the TikTok video in 2020, the Lopez father-daughter team reunited after a long apart to launch a program based on their life.</p><h2>Mayan Lopez has been separated from her father for over ten years.</h2><p>Mayan Lopez was born on April 2, 1996, in San Fernando, California, to George Lopez and Ann Serrano Lopez. In college, she studied comedic writing and acting with the intention of appearing on Saturday Night Live. She also studied Sketch Comedy and Improvisation at the Second City Conservatory in Chicago.&nbsp;Mayan has a lot of experience since she was there while her father was shooting his program George Lopez, which premiered on ABC in 2002. Now, twenty years later, she is returning to the big screen, bringing her father with her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mayan-Lopez-1.jpg alt="Mayan Lopez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When the 26-year-old TV debutante’s parents divorced in public, she was fifteen years old. She told The New York Post that she felt compelled to air her family’s dirty laundry on social media, detailing how her father was adulterous, how her mother donated a kidney to him, and how they later separated.&nbsp;She reasoned that as a comic, she should be able to shrug it off. And with that information, she has developed a show about her failed relationship. Lopez vs. Lopez follows George and Mayan Lopez’s relationship as it begins to heal after almost a decade of estrangement.</p><p>Their real-life narrative adds weight to their on-screen personalities as they struggle to repair their bonds after George’s failings as a husband and parent.&nbsp;Naturally, the process has not been simple. Mayan Lopez said that some scars never heal, but working together has been really beneficial. She stated:</p><p>“I believe that certain scars never heal. Working together has not been simple, but it has been very therapeutic. I believe the past can be put behind us and we can work together to create a better future.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mayan-Lopez-2.jpg alt="Mayan Lopez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>George Lopez also mentioned him working with his daughter after a long time. He told Universal Studios Hollywood that he is thrilled to have the opportunity to reunite with her. He proceeded to discuss the procedure, saying:</p><p>“This is the happiest I’ve ever been in my life.”</p><p>Mayan Lopez also serves as the show’s producer and contributes to the writing room.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmrGRo3qtu8%2BesWaqlaq7qsDEnWSwoaSdeqmx0WadmqyYmr9urcWtnKtlo6R6rq3NsmSynZGnwG7Ax6umrp%2BYYsCwr8iao2allZm2ons%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
