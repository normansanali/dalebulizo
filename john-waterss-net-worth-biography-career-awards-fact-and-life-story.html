Born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1946, John Waters attended New York University but quickly left and returned to Baltimore to make short films. He’s perhaps best known for “Hairspray”, which started out as a movie in 1988 and was eventually adapted into an award-winning Broadway musical. He has written and directed more than a dozen films, including “Hag in a Black Leather Jacket”, “Pink Flamingos”, “Female Trouble”, “Desperate Living”, “Polyester”, “Cry-Baby”, “Serial Mom” and “A Dirty Shame”. Waters also has several acting credits to his name with appearances in “Homer and Eddie”, “Sweet and Lowdown”, “Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat”, “Jackass: Number Two”, “Hairspray” and “Seed of Chucky”. He’s worked as a narrator and voice actor, lending his pipes to pieces such as “The Junior Defenders” and “Animal Planet: Jessica the Hippo”. Waters has been an artist and art collector since the ’90s with exhibits in New York and Los Angeles. He has a personal collection of more than eight thousand books. He was once granted the opportunity to interview his childhood idol, Little Richard, but has said it turned into a total disaster. Waters has publicly come out as gay and is an outspoken gay rights advocate.</p><p>Real Estate: John Waters has homes around the country including apartments in San Francisco and New York as well as a large country home outside of Baltimore and a summer house in Provincetown, Massachusetts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKfnbtuw8CtnKuro2K7psCMsKarrJhir6q7xquYqaCpYrCivsSeqWaZp5a%2Fpb%2BMn5icrF2Wu6V5y6KdnmWjqbyzxY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
