So great job, Peter! You made all your money, you became the most famous dwarf in America, and then you ruined the acting roles that were available for six other dwarfs who just want to work as paid actors like you did.”</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>You get the sneaking suspicion that one interview made in isolation by Dinklage didn’t directly influence the decision-making on a $200 million blockbuster, and even if it did, then you’d image the acclaimed actor would have addressed the situation by now given his no-nonsense stance on pretty much everything.</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=false>Disney did initially deny the set photos were real before backtracking and labeling them “unofficial” instead, but we can brace ourselves knowing another ideological conflict is brewing ahead of Snow White‘s release next year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8%2Beq56qXZm2r7fLmp6eZZeawbW1zaBkraCVYq%2BtrcyeZJ%2BnomLBqbvSnmSspp%2Bseri0yK2cZquVqXqxtM6tpqxllJ7Ar7HYZpuemqWjuKawjJqlnWWknbKvecKopZ%2BhoqKypXnIrGSwoKlixKZ5wpqlrWWYlsOmec2imp5lpJ22r7PSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
