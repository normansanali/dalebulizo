A servant of Seward's answered an evening knock at the door by Lewis Powell, who claimed to be delivering medicine to the ailing government official (via <a href=#>CBS</a>). After being denied entry, the visitor charged through the front door. His path blocked by one of Seward's sons, the intruder brandished a revolver and tried to fire it. It misfired, so he hit Seward's son with it instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Now brandishing a knife, the intruder made his way to the senior Seward's room. He managed to stab him twice, before being himself attacked by Seward's other son and a bodyguard. In a panic, the would-be assassin managed to stab or strike eight people. Fortunately, all survived their injuries (via CBS).</p><p>While Powell managed to escape, he was later apprehended at a boarding house owned by Mary Surratt. Federal agents were at Surratt's boarding house questioning her about Booth, whom officials knew she was well acquainted with. Powell, hurt and in blood-soaked clothing, was placed under arrest (via CBS).</p><p>When word of Seward's attack reached Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Stanton feared there was a massive attack on high-ranking government officials. He ordered the city locked down, and sent hundreds of federal agents to various positions around the nation's capitol (via <a href=#>History Collection</a>). Meanwhile, Vice President Andrew Johnson slept quietly in his room at Kirkwood House. Another would-be assassin was preparing to kill him in his sleep.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCkGpqaW1fqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZquhnV2irq%2B01KerZp6fp3qru8enZLChnKCytHnBqKatoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
