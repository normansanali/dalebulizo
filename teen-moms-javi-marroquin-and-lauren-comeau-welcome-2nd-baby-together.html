They split four years later before he moved on with Comeau. Marroquin and Comeau had briefly called it quits in 2020 before ultimately reconciling in 2023.</p><p class=p1>After Marroquin and Comeau split and called off their engagement, rumors swirled that he had an affair with Lowry. Marroquin, meanwhile, denied the claims, which <a href=#>sparked a falling-out</a> with the <i>16 and Pregnant </i>alum.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Since then, Lowry has tried to amicably coparent with Marroquin and her other exes. She also shares Isaac, 13, with <strong>Jo Rivera</strong>, Lux, 3, and Creed, 3, with <strong>Chris Lopez</strong>, and Rio, 12 months, and twins Verse and Valley, 4 months, with current boyfriend <strong>Elijah Scott.</strong></p><p class=p1>“We’re coparenting. We’re trying to do the best we can,” Lowry <a href=#>exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>in May 2021. “I think all [my relationships with them are] a work in progress. We have really, really good periods of time and then we’ll hit a bump in the road. I think all of them are the same in that way.”</p><p class=p1>She continued at the time, “I think that a huge part of coparenting is really compromising and understanding the other parent’s point of view for the best interest of the child. Jo and I have been doing this for 11 years, and we’re still a work in progress.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatnZWjeq67zKxko5mmnnqurdGrpqqtmaN6orrDZqOaraKau26vzqacmq1drLKtr86mnGZqnpl6o63BsmStp5eawamx0Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
