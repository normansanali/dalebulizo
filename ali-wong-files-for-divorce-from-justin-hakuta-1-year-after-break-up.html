(TMZ reported that the divorce docs list their date of separation in the same month.)</p><p class=p3>“I did not expect the announcement to be so widespread, but by far the hardest part about getting divorced was my mother’s reaction,” Wong recalled to <a href=# rel=noopener><i>The Hollywood Reporter </i></a>in February. “I had told her before that I thought we might get divorced, and she was really upset.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ali-Wong-Officially-Files-for-Divorce-From-Estranged-Husband-Justin-Hakuta-2.jpg><p class=p3>The actress continued: “She looked me in the eye and asked, ‘Can you just wait until I die?’ She was literally asking me to not live a life for myself. But she’s 82, what do I expect? She hasn’t had her period in 40 years. She’s in the sha-ha-hallows of senior citizenship. But it was still really f—king hard dealing with all her fear of the shame it would bring her.”</p><p class=p3>Since Wong and Hakuta announced their split, she added to <i>THR</i> that her mom “still sees” Hakuta “a ton.”</p><p class=p3>Hakuta, a former tech executive, has even retained his job as Wong’s tour manager during her live comedy gigs.</p><p class=p3>“We’re really close. We’re really good friends [and] when I say that, I really mean it,” Wong said on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> in March, noting she would be “fine” if Hakuta met a date while they were traveling together. “I don’t know, I haven’t thought about that.”</p><p class=p3>Wong, for her part, <a href=#>has moved on</a> with fellow comedian and actor <strong>Bill Hader</strong>. Wong and Hader, 45, briefly dated in late 2022 before <a href=#>rekindling their romance</a> earlier this year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>“They’re actually perfect for each other,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>in April. “They have a lot in common.
