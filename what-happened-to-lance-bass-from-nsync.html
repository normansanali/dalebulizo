When recalling the brave decision during a 2019 appearance on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a>, the "Tearin Up My Heart" singer admitted to having slept with several women during his NSYNC days. "I was doing it and doing it and doing it well," Bass jokingly said. "Doing what we had to do to survive."</p><p>As it t turns out, he even became a member of the "mile high club" during this time. "It was on a BBJ — a Boeing Business Jet — because it has a bed!" Bass dished of the experience, "It was with a woman. I know. Breaking news!"</p><p>In 2014, Bass married his husband, Michael Turchin. He celebrated their fourth anniversary in December 2018 with a touching <a href=#>Instagram</a> photo from their wedding day. "I love you dearly my Mookie Picasso," he wrote. "To the moon. I can't wait to keep dancing with you for eternity." He also added the hashtag, "#LanceLovesMichael." The couple has been transparent about their <a href=#>desire to start a family via surrogacy</a>, and in 2019, Bass opened up about how much longer the process has taken for them than expected. Then, in March 2020, Bass revealed that his surrogate had a pregnancy loss with the couple's baby boy. Bass told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> about the situation, "I'm not opposed to going right ahead and adopting if this fails next time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3FpbIN1e9ahmK1lmJa9sbHNnptmrJ9iuaK6wp5km5mjqHqnvs6mZKerqaOwcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
