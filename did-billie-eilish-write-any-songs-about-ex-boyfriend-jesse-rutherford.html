As he told Billboard, “We made the whole thing in the bedroom. People are often like, ‘When you think about when you first started making music to like now, from a bedroom to a studio…’ — and we’re like, ‘No. We’re still in the same bedroom.'”</p><p>Eilish also told Billboard, “This album is all me. Nobody’s name. It’s kind of like a coming-of-age album. I’m 17. I did mostly everything for the first time last year. So it’s weird.
