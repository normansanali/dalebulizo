Fans continue to wonder who Saraya’s mystery partner will be for the upcoming tag team match on the 11th January edition of AEW Dynamite. Now it seems Tony Khan decided to give an interesting reply when he was asked about the mystery partner.</p><p>Sasha Banks is essentially done with WWE following her walkout on Monday Night RAW back in May of this year. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As previously reported</a>, Sasha Banks is set to attend the Wrestle Kingdom 17 event in Tokyo Dome on January 4th, 2023.</p><p>Saraya is also set to face Britt Baker and Jamie Hayter on the January 11th episode of AEW Dynamite with a mystery partner. Many believe that the partner will be none other than Sasha Banks.</p><p>While speaking in&nbsp;a new interview with <a href=#>Grapsody for&nbsp;Fightful</a>, Tony Khan was asked about Banks potentially being Saraya’s partner. Khan simply gave a very intriguing reply in return and didn’t say more than necessary.</p><p>“Not at this time. I don’t think it would behoove me right now. Well, in January, you’re definitely going to find out who it is. You will know in January, but right now is probably not something that serves my interests well. To quote Gerri Kellman from Succession, ‘How does it serve my interests?’ [laughter].”</p><p>AEW was&nbsp;<a href=#>also advised to release talent and sign Sasha Banks</a>. Booker T also believes Sasha Banks would <a href=#>overshadow everyone in the AEW women’s division</a>. We’ll have to see whether Banks will make her way to AEW in the future.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Do you think Sasha Banks will ever go to AEW?
