“I’ve had anxiety my whole life really,” the 45-year-old told CBS’ Sunday Morning in a Sunday, February 27 interview. “And you know, I feel like I have two parts of my personality, that one takes over when that happens.”
The Deadpool actor is known for being witty and charismatic, but that’s not how he feels backstage."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He recalled feeling overwhelmingly nervous before an appearance on Late Night With David Letterman, which he appeared on several times before the host signed off in 2015.</p><p>“I remember I’d be standing backstage before the curtain would open, and I would think to myself, ‘I’m gonna die. I’m literally gonna die here. The curtain’s gonna open and I’m just gonna be, I’m just gonna be a symphony of vomit,’ just, like, something horrible’s gonna happen!” Reynolds revealed.</p><p>However, his worries were unfounded because his personality shifted as soon as he was in the spotlight. “But as soon as that curtain opens – and this happens in my work a lot too – it’s like this little guy takes over,” the Free Guy star recalled. “And he’s like, ‘I got this. You’re cool.’ I feel, like, my heart rate drop, and my breathing calm, and I just sort of go out and I’m this different person. And I leave that interview going, ‘God, I’d love to be that guy!'”</p><p>The star of Netflix’s March movie The Adam Project started to open up about his mental state within the last year. In May 2021, Reynolds <a href=#>revealed his struggle with anxiety</a> during Mental Health Awareness Month.</p><p>“To all those like me who overschedule, overthink, overwork, over-worry and over-everything, please know you’re not alone,” the Vancouver native wrote via Instagram at the time.</p><p>“I fixate on things,” he told the WSJ Magazine in October. “That’s sort of the engine of anxiety. I lay awake at night, wrapping and unwrapping every possible scenario.”</p><p>Reynolds, who <a href=#>shares daughters</a> James, 7, Inez, 5, and Betty, 2, with wife <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>, said he uses meditation and mindfulness to stay calm.</p><p>“I tend to pave over anxiety with work and, to a lesser extent, achievement,” he explained. “You want to tick boxes sometimes. So these days, my goal is to be as present as I can and not just tick a box just to do it. I’m fully embracing and living that right now. It’s been amazing.”</p><p>He also wants to be present with his children. Reynolds shared the news that <a href=#>he was taking some time off</a> as he celebrated finishing a holiday film, Spirited, in October 2021. He called the <a href=#><strong>Will Ferrell</strong> </a>flick “challenging” for him and added that it “made a whole lotta dreams come true.” That’s why it felt like the right moment for a step back.</p><p>“Perfect time for a little sabbatical from movie making,” he added via Instagram at the time. “I’m gonna miss every second working with this obscenely gifted group of creators and artists.”</p><p>He later revealed that he was focusing on his business ventures, such as <a href=#>Maximum Effort</a>, Mint Mobile and <a href=#>Aviation Gin</a>, during daytime hours while his daughters were at school. Then, he gets to be in full dad-mode when the girls are at home, and Lively, 34, can take time to focus on some projects away from home as well.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The married couple joined forces<a href=#> to fundraise for Ukrainian refugees</a> on Saturday, February 26. Amid the Russian troops invading the neighboring country, the Simple Favor actress and her husabnd announced they are matching $1 million of donations to The UN Refugee agency, USA for UNHCR (The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees).</p><p>“In 48 hours, countless Ukrainians were forced to flee their homes to neighbouring countries,” Reynolds wrote via Instagram. “They need protection. @usaforunhcr is providing it. When you donate, we’ll match it up to $1,000,000, creating DOUBLE the support.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarsZGjerOx2KempZyjYq6vxMieq7JlnJqut7HSZp%2BipV2bsqa4yKeeZqSZoLJurYydoJ%2Belaeyr8CMqZyrq5%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
