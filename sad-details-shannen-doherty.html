Moreover, she was offered the options of paying up to $5,000 in fines and penalties or doing an 80-hour community service. The actor had supposedly bashed a car window with a beer bottle during an attempt to strike a man who was inside.</p><p dir=ltr>Still, Doherty's troubles with the law continued. On December 28, 2000, she was arrested for driving while inebriated. It was a choice she had deep regret for. "Thank God, I did not injure anybody," Doherty said during a talk, according to People (via <a href=#>ABC News</a>). "There hasn't been a day gone by that I haven't wanted to relive that decision to get in my car." The result was a 10-hour stint in jail and a work release program whose alternative would have been a two-day jail sentence.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know is struggling with addiction issues, help is available.
