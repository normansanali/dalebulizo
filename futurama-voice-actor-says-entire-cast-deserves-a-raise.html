Fans are threatening to boycott the series if John DiMaggio isn’t bought back to reprise his role of the foul-mouthed robot Bender. The voice actor&nbsp;is refusing to sign a deal <a href=#>until he gets paid more</a>, and now he’s saying <a href=#>the entire cast deserves a bigger paycheck as well</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last week, Hulu announced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 20-episode reboot of the show</a>. Almost&nbsp;all of the original voice cast had signed on, including Katey Sagal and Billy West had agreed to return as&nbsp;the voices of&nbsp;Leela and Fry, respectively.</p><p>But the list of returning voice actors had one glaring&nbsp;omission. DiMaggio, who voiced&nbsp;the&nbsp;fan-favorite character Bender, has yet to&nbsp;ink a deal. Variety reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DiMaggio is willing to return</a> to the show and the producers are eager to bring him back, but negotiations have recently hit a standstill.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Simpsons: The Financial Success Of Animation's Royal Family</a></span></p><p>DiMaggio took to Twitter to address the situation on Tuesday night. He claimed&nbsp;that not only does he deserve more money, but that the rest of the voice actors on the show should be getting paid more too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’ve been thinking about everything that’s been going on these past months, and just to be clear, I don’t think that only I deserve to be paid more. I think the entire cast does,” DiMaggio tweeted. “Negotiations are a natural part of working in show business. Everyone has a different strategy and different boundaries… Some accept offers, some hold their ground.”</p><p>DiMaggio is holding his ground and undoubtedly knows how important his character is to the series. He also has a legion of fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">threatening to boycott the show if he isn’t a part of it.</a></p><p>This is the series second reboot. Futurama originally aired on Fox, but the network canceled the show in 2003. Comedy Central signed a deal to bring the show back in 2008 and <a href=#>aired original episodes until the show was axed again in 2013</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn’t the first time the show has had disputes with pay. After Comedy Central picked up the show, they refused to pay the voice actors the $75,000 per episode they demanded. They allegedly even threatened to hold auditions to replace the voice actors if they declined a pay cut.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Animated Millions: 10 Highest Grossing Animated Films Of 2021</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HypeBeast</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWire</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSztsDUq5immV2rvKqvxGaYnKyfp3q0rdisZJ6mpJ6%2FpnnCmqqtZZSawKa%2B1Z6qZpldp66qv8Ro</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
