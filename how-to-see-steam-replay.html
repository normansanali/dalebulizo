Spotify compiles "<a href=#>Wrapped</a>" playlists for all of its users to track a year of music streaming. Instagram allows you to create a <a href=#>Recap reel</a> to tally up your favorite posts.</p><p>But if anyone has a sizeable amount of activity to tally up, it's gamers. This year saw the release of several high-profile titles on PC. The arrival of the <a href=#>Steam Deck</a> this year also meant that those with Steam accounts were getting plenty of use out of their libraries on the new portable console. It's safe to say that gamers on Steam accomplished much in 2022.</p><p>To capitalize on Steam's hype, the platform recently rolled out its own year-end round-up called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Replay</a>.

In the style of functions like Spotify Wrapped, Steam Replay compiles data on the titles you loved and the games you spent the most time playing. It even tabulates how many sessions of a particular game you've played as well as percentages of which games took up most of your gaming hours. You can even scroll through to check out different stats.</p><p>Replay keeps track of how many achievements you've unlocked, your "longest streak" of daily gaming, and how many new releases you've checked out. It even breaks down your gaming habits by genre. You can also check out your gaming accomplishments for individual titles.</p><p>Luckily, seeing your Steam Replay is easy, and there are a number of ways you can do it. You can visit the Steam Replay site <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and log into your account to view your stats.</p><p>Alternatively, you can launch the Steam app itself and scroll through the Special Offers window to find a button that says "VIEW YOUR STEAM REPLAY."
