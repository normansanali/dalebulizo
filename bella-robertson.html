The couple made things official on Instagram via a post in 2018. Lev uploaded a photo of the pair on Instagram with the caption “Major heart eyes…what’s new.” Their families seemed to be fully behind the romance as both Korie and Candace posted regular photos of the pair on their Instagram including the ones from prom.
