However, 2baba found another way to communicate with her.</p><p>Despite knowing that 2baba might be upset with her for sharing the video online, Annie couldn’t resist showcasing his efforts in learning her language. She posted a video of him singing in her language.</p><p>Annie expressed her happiness and admiration for the extra effort that 2baba was putting in to learn her language.</p><p>In her own words, “And so this happened 2 nights ago… Unto #mizzingtinz. I know ‘A guy’ is gonna kill me for this, but oh well, all die na die. We’ve been missing each other’s phone calls, due to our tight schedules, etc.! And he sent this… Unto #missingTinz.”</p><p>She then provided an interpretation of the lyrics in her language in the video:</p><li>“They know me from Akwa Ibom – just look at that.”</li><li>“They know me from Akwa Ibom – their love is blazing/fire. 3know me from Akwa Ibom – Love lives there.”</li><li>“They know me from Akwa Ibom – This is love.”</li><li>“It is love. Awwww baby, it is soooooooo cute how you make an effort to learn my language and still use it soooooo brilliantly in your songs.”</li><p>Annie then tagged some friends and celebrities, asking for their interpretation and jokingly mentioning that 2baba’s mother should see the video.</p><p>In a previous month, Annie Idibia explained why she didn’t publicly celebrate her husband, 2baba, on his birthday in September. She revealed that her heart was heavy, so she purposely didn’t do anything special for his birthday.</p><p>Annie made it clear that despite not celebrating him publicly, she cherished every day with him and considered it a rare blessing and celebration.</p><p>Expressing her love and admiration for 2baba, Annie described him as a man with a heart of gold, someone who sees the best in everyone, never judges, and is incredibly selfless.</p><p>A few days ago, Annie reassured 2baba of her love for him and stated that it has always been and would always be him. She proclaimed him as her soulmate and expressed how they are meant for each other, promising to love him until death separates them.</p><p>This assurance came after 2baba expressed his concerns about possibly losing Annie to another man, emphasizing his fear of losing her.</p><p><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiYp6aZmnqqsMiboJpll6rAqbHSZqavnaJitba%2FwZqlnWVil66jrdJmnJ%2Ben6fBbsDOZqOemaKjeqmx0WajmqaXqq6osYyvoJ2dn2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
