In a statement to the police, Lisa alleged that Lloyd arrived at his house and began berating her verbally. He then progressed to physically assault her, but she didn’t press charges because he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was not taking his medicines.</p><p>On June 17, 2015, Jake was arrested in South Carolina for reckless driving, driving without a license, and resisting arrest.
