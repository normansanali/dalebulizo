Over the course of his 11-year stint, he created many famous impressions, including his turn as President Barack Obama. "So they gave me a wig and stuck my ears out a little bit. A million things came together at once to make it happen," Armisen told <a href=#>Mustard</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>In 2011, the star launched the comedy sketch show, "Portlandia," alongside Sleater Kinney guitarist, Carrie Brownstein and it became an instant hit.&nbsp;Just two years later, he announced his departure from "SNL," later telling&nbsp;<a href=#>Esquire</a>, "I remember Amy Poehler telling me, 'You'll know when it's time to go. And don't worry, everyone stays in your life" — and many of them did.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Armisen went on to guest-star in Andy Samberg's "Brooklyn Nine-Nine," <a href=#>Amy Poehler's show, "Parks and Recreation"</a> and in "30 Rock" with former "Weekend Update" anchor, Tina Fey. He also played Tino in "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," which stars his former "SNL" castmate,&nbsp;Will Ferrell. Additionally, Armisen teamed up with Seth Meyers and Bill Hader on the mockumentary series, "Documentary Now!" And in 2021, he showed off his musical comedy skills as Reverend Howard Layton in the Apple TV+ series "Schmigadoon," which was created by "SNL" producer Lorne Michaels. It seems those "Saturday Night Live" connections have really paid off!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamliZ4V4g46tn55lk5bAtXnOn2SwnZSjsrSwwLJkmqaUYsSpsdGeZLKnpauybr%2FEnqVmrJiaum6uxJ%2Bmq51f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
