New York feels like Fairbanks, Alaska, at the moment — only without the northern lights and picturesque landscape. Truly, the only fun I’m having as I fight my way to the local bodega for oat milk is accessorizing for the weather: picking out different scarves, gloves and hats to shield my skin."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Truly, the only fun I’m having as I fight my way to the local bodega for oat milk is accessorizing for the weather: picking out different scarves, gloves and hats to shield my skin.</p><p>After all, in the fashion-forward city of New York, dressing stylishly and documenting the latest trends is not just a choice I enjoy but a literal part of my job. Below, I’ll share my favorite oversized scarves that double as office chair blankets, as well as winter hats and warm gloves that have become my new favorite accessories.</p><p>If the idea of wearing a unique hat seems daring (and I assure you, it’s not), let me recount a personal story. For the longest time, I hesitated to embrace hats — until I witnessed <strong>Jeff Goldblum</strong> confidently sporting a charming blue fedora onstage at the Paris Theater in New York. His simple desire to wear it made me question my own predispositions — and wasn’t that reason enough to make a change?</p><p>While I may not possess the same charm as Goldblum, I’ve decided to wear his confidence in the form of a hat on my own head, and it’s a decision I do not regret. Hats also shield you from the rain and cover up the messiest of hairstyles. So, let’s dive into the accessories I’ve chosen for warmth, confidence and style, shall we?</p><h4><strong>Hats</strong></h4><p><strong>1.
