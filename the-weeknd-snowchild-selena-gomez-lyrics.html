Coincidence? I think not.
Selena turned 28 on Wednesday, July 22. Meanwhile, The Weeknd hopped on Twitter Wednesday morning to announce that his official music video for “Snowchild” would be dropping “in a couple hours."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Coincidence? I think not.</p><p>Selena turned 28 on Wednesday, July 22. Meanwhile, <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-weeknd data-tag=the-weeknd>The Weeknd</a> hopped on Twitter Wednesday morning to announce that his official music video for “Snowchild” would be dropping “in a couple hours.” By Wednesday afternoon, the 30-year-old singer shared the link to the video on his social media accounts.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/selena-gomez-love-on.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/timothee-kylie-selena-taylor.png><p>The anime-style music video was produced by D’ART Shtajio, the “first black owned anime studio,” according to a tweet by Tesfaye. In it, the singer cycles through past versions of himself as a performer. But fans also noticed that there are potential hints hidden in the music video—many of which seem to address his <a href=#>ex-girlfriend, Selena</a>. It wouldn’t be the first time The Weeknd has <a href=#>referenced his ex</a>, nor is it the first instance that fans see the similarities in Selena’s rumored <a href=#>songs about him</a>.</p><p>This time around, some of those features include balloons within the very first 20 seconds of the music video for “Snowchild”—a possible reference to Selena’s birthday—whereas others noted the backdrop of several scenes appear similar to the “Lose You to Love Me” singer’s photoshoots, including houses and staircases. It’s worth noting, however, that other fans have interpreted the balloon imagery as a reference to the House of Balloons-era mixtape released by The Weeknd in 2011.</p><p>But if the music video references aren’t enough to convince you, there are still more hints that have fans talking. Namely, Selenators know that their idol has said that “Snowchild” was her favorite song by The Weeknd in the past. In fact, the singer even listed the track on her official “Cooking Together” playlist on Spotify in April.</p><p>Even though it’s been over three years since Selena and The Weeknd dated in 2017, the potential references to each other in their music still haven’t let up. Whether it leads to a rekindled romance or friendship, we’re all for it.
