Once harvested, sour blueberries will stay sour for the rest of their life. Once you‚Äôve picked the blueberries from the bush, there‚Äôs no way to sweeten them. Try eating a few berries before starting your collection, and keep in mind that not all berries mature at the same time. Waiting is an effective method of sweetening sour blueberries.
