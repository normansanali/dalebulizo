As a result, creating new accounts is part of her weekly routine. Christen keeps inviting drama into her life through her ex-boyfriend or friends.</p><p>Here’s what the Reddit discussion panel has to say about Tik Tok star Christen Whitman. Some describe her as “super annoying and self-entitled”, while others might argue the opposite. One of the members wrote, ‘I absolutely adore her, love her personality as she doesn’t care about what anybody thinks.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christen-gets-into-the-heated-conversation-with-the-creator-auntkaren></span>Christen Gets Into The Heated Conversation With The Creator, AuntKaren<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A couple of weeks ago Christen had another drama coming up her way which involves her mother Jackie. In one of her daughter’s Tik Tok, Jackie made a comment about the ‘N-word saying, “If the word is so offensive, nobody should say it”.</p><p>Some other guy said, ‘White people created the word; why can’t white people use it? To which Christen’s mother would respond with a ‘laugh’. The situation escalated from then on.</p><p>One creator, ‘Aunt Karen, finds the whole situation offensive and managed to get on a live interview with Christen and her mother. They all have a heated conversation around racism for more than half an hour, going back and forth.</p><p>‘Agreeing with a racist comment makes you racist’, one of the comments said. To its counterpart, one user responded, ‘laughing in such a situation is normal; people do it when they’re not comfortable.</p><p>It’s true Christen’s mother didn’t use or say the actual “N-word”. In the meantime, Christen fans were all over her comment section, defending her mother while some were with Karen.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-is-christen-whitman-putting-aside-all-her-drama></span>How Is Christen Whitman Putting Aside All Her Drama?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>More often than not, Whitman shares incredible pictures on her Instagram. Her feed is full of glamour and fashion. She’s often seen wearing bikinis and lingerie, sometimes in a villa, her apartment, or on some sunny beaches in Florida.</p><p>Though she is not known to be a model, her physics, aura, and the way she presents herself comfortably in front of the camera really make her followers think if she actually is a model.</p><p>Bue-eyed blonde has an attractive figure, and her fans are as crazy about her as she is when making viral Tik Tok videos.</p><p>Although, we can say she loves fashion and everything about traveling since she was a kid. Christen is quite popular on Tik Tok in the States, but she still has reserved her personal details away from her fans.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christen-whitman-has-a-net-worth-of-100000></span>Christen Whitman Has A Net Worth Of $100,000<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite all the drama, Christen Whitman has made quite the following on Instagram.
