His page features a wide range of scientifically-oriented uploads ranging from legitimately informative to just plain entertaining. He’s tested sharks’ ability to “smell” blood, pitched ideas for the “perfect” egg drop experiment, and provided advice on everything from “how to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">survive a grenade blast</a>” to “how to measure <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how much pee</a> is in your pool.” He even went viral a few years ago after his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">brilliant deterrent</a> for package thieves caught the eye of the internet.</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>Rober turned this success of his YouTube channel, simply titled “Mark Rober,” into a legitimately lucrative career. The 41-year-old YouTuber shifted from a nine-year career at NASA — during which he worked on the Curiosity rover — to a four-year stint at Apple working as a product designer. His career path eventually led him to YouTube, where he’s earned a solid following from those with an interest in engineering and its various real-life applications.</p><h2 id=h-mark-rober-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>Mark Rober’s net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true>Rober’s channel currently has 24.7 million subscribers, and his numbers rise every day. He’s been making uploads to the platform for just under a decade, with his oldest videos offering odd and interesting “how-tos” and experiments. His videos have earned a staggering view count in the billions, with some individual uploads collecting tens of millions of views all on their own.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>That dedication to his YouTube channel earned Rober an income in the millions as well. He pulls in more than $1 million a year and has an estimated net worth of $5 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. These estimations largely lean on the revenue Rober makes from his YouTube channel, which typically sees more than 580,000 views per day. That puts his earnings from ad revenue around $70,000 per month, an enviable number for any YouTube creator.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Rober likely made a solid income during his time at NASA and Apple, but neither job earned him quite as much as he’s making now on a monthly basis. Thankfully, he used the experience he gained in both positions to fuel his creative fire, resulting in a stellar and informative YouTube channel that the world can enjoy for years to come. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZqGnp2K6tq%2FHZpuonaNiuqK%2BymapqJqVp3qurcqeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
