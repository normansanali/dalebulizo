Patty Loveless Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴Well, good mornin'
Tell me how'd you sleep last night
You're still smiling
So we must've done something right
Don't feel guilty
Because you turned to me last nightWe ain't done nothin' wrong We've just been lonely too long
No, we ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too longIt's only natural
When you've been too long in the dark To look for comfort And to warm yourself by the fire"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The lyrics describe a conversation between these two people. The first verse shows the man asking the woman how she slept and noticing that she is still smiling, implying that something positive had occurred between them the night before. The second verse describes how it's natural to seek comfort when in the dark for too long, but both are afraid of getting hurt. The chorus emphasizes that there is nothing wrong with finding comfort in each other, even if they have been lonely for a long time. The bridge indicates that with the right person, anything can be cured and the singer will be waiting for the other person to turn to them if needed.</p><br><p>The song portrays two people who are trying to find comfort in each other due to their loneliness, but are hesitant to put themselves out there due to past experiences of getting hurt. However, they reassure each other that they have not done anything wrong and being lonely for too long is tough. They both want to find someone and hope that their relationship can grow and be fulfilling. The lyrics tell a story of two friends who are taking the necessary steps to put themselves back on track.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Well, good mornin'</u><br>Speaker greets the listener and initiates conversation</p><br><p><u>Tell me how'd you sleep last night</u><br>Speaker inquires about the listener's sleep</p><br><p><u>You're still smiling</u><br>Speaker notes the listener's positive affect</p><br><p><u>So we must've done something right</u><br>Speaker deduces that they successfully helped the listener</p><br><p><u>Don't feel guilty</u><br>Speaker reassures the listener that they did not engage in wrongdoing</p><br><p><u>Because you turned to me last night</u><br>Speaker notes that the listener sought comfort in them</p><br><p><u>We ain't done nothin' wrong</u><br>Speaker restates that the actions taken were not illicit</p><br><p><u>We've just been lonely too long</u><br>Speaker conveys that loneliness has driven their actions</p><br><p><u>It's only natural</u><br>Speaker suggests that seeking comfort is a reasonable response to isolation</p><br><p><u>When you've been too long in the dark</u><br>Speaker metaphorically describes emotional isolation</p><br><p><u>To look for comfort</u><br>Speaker proposes that seeking solace is a coping mechanism</p><br><p><u>And to warm yourself by the fire</u><br>Speaker contrasts coldness with warmth to highlight loneliness</p><br><p><u>We're just afraid</u><br>Speaker reveals an underlying fear</p><br><p><u>That we might get our fingers burned</u><br>Speaker uses a metaphor to describe fear of emotional pain</p><br><p><u>Nothing's wrong that can't be cured</u><br>Speaker offers reassurance that their situation is fixable</p><br><p><u>With a new love</u><br>Speaker suggests that a romantic partner could remedy their loneliness</p><br><p><u>All you need is someone like me to</u><br>Speaker promotes the idea that they could be the solution</p><br><p><u>Be sure of, to be your love</u><br>Speaker offers themselves as a reliable romantic partner</p><br><p><u>I'll be waiting</u><br>Speaker communicates willingness to be patient and supportive</p><br><p><u>Standing right outside your heart</u><br>Speaker uses a metaphor to describe being emotionally available</p><br><p><u>And I'll be watching</u><br>Speaker implies attentiveness and care</p><br><p><u>For the slightest sign of a spark</u><br>Speaker uses a metaphor to suggest looking for signs of interest or attraction</p><br><p><u>And I'll be here</u><br>Speaker reiterates availability</p><br><p><u>If you should want to turn to me</u><br>Speaker invites the listener to seek their company</p><br><p><u>'Cause we ain't done nothin' wrong</u><br>Speaker emphasizes that their behavior was not harmful</p><br><p><u>We've just been lonely too long</u><br>Speaker restates that loneliness is the root of their actions</p><br><p><u>We ain't done nothin' wrong</u><br>Speaker reiterates that no moral transgression occurred</p><br><p><u>We've both been lonely too long</u><br>Speaker conveys their shared experience of isolation</p><br><p><u>Oh, just been lonely too long</u><br>Speaker emphasizes the duration and intensity of their loneliness</p><br><p><u>Both been lonely too long</u><br>Speaker restates their mutual experience of isolation</p><br><p><u>Just been lonely too long</u><br>Speaker reiterates that loneliness has been the driving force behind their actions</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © BMG Rights Management, Universal Music Publishing Group, Bluewater Music Corp.<br>Written by: Al Anderson, Bill Rice, Craig Wiseman, Mike Lawler, Sharon Vaughn</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIiRqcG6q6uorZ6klajAcJjOp5ylsY%2BJvLCrq6iloA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
