Dan has been accused of several physical and sexual assaults over the course and one of his accusers has been none than his ex-wife, Kristie Colón. Time and again Kristie has attempted to inform people about Dan’s behavior.</p><p style=text-align:left>With that being said, let’s find out who Kristie Colón is in this writing called ‘Kristie Colón Bio’.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Kristie Colón, Dan Price Ex-Wife</strong></h3><p>Dan Price was previously married to Kristie Colón.</p><p>They likely started dating in high school in 2000, tied the knot in 2005 when in college, and remained in the marriage for roughly seven years before separating reportedly in February 2012. It was also said that the divorce filed by Kristie in 2011 went amicably. It was seemingly later that their equation truly changed maybe after Kristie shared in a TEDx talk that she was abused by an unnamed former husband she was married to.</p><p>A Bloomberg report recounted an October 2015 TEDx talk given by Colon during which she described being beaten and waterboarded by her ex, without naming Price. Price told Bloomberg those events “never happened.”</p><p>Some seven years ago, when Dan stunned his 100-plus workers when he told them he was cutting his roughly $1 million salary to $70,000, that same year, allegations that Dan had abused his ex-wife (Kristie) also surfaced. Media outlets at the time had recounted a not-published October 2015 TEDx&nbsp;at Kentucky University given by Kristie where she describes being beaten and waterboarded by her ex. Kristie for sure did not name Dan but she also said at the time that she had been married once. As for Dan, he later recounted that these events never happened.</p><p>Not to miss, the year she read out loud the records of violence from her journal at TEDx, she also claimed that she had miscarried that same year.</p><p>Speaking of her reaction to Dan’s recent resignation “to focus full time on fighting false accusations” made against him, Kristie retweeted an article by The New York Times about Dan Price’s resignation and his one-time reputation and added her own words: “No person owes the world the story of their pain. Surviving is truly enough. I know what it costs, to tell the truth over and over and over again. Thank you to those who told theirs here.”</p><p>Her post from 19 August 2022 has since picked up several comments commending her strength and braveness.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Kristie Colón Relationship Status Now</strong></h3><p>Months after Dan Price’s big announcement in April 2015, Kristie Colón changed her name from her maiden name Kristie Lewellyn to her now-name Kristie Colón.
