Despite the fact that the 23-year-old rugby player chose to couple up with Paige, he has continued to have a friendship with Michael Owen's daughter – and Stephanie has revealed it has the basis to become the "love connection of a lifetime."</p><p id=e3I1axGppvGP data-wc=27>The exes admitted they dated for eight months and have not divulged the reason for their split, but they have admitted they still care for each other.</p><p id=eQ-0MigIOzNV data-wc=24>"According to Kegel8’s latest star sign compatibility study, the football pundit’s daughter might have the 'love connection of a lifetime' with the Cumbrian lad.</p><p id=eD2C1lzmxOXD data-wc=51>"Both Taurus', Jacques is Gemma's strong astrological love match so far this series. When together, the pair will spoil one another - and there will be plenty of romance and total devotion. But it's their stubborn, jealous, opinionated, and possessive nature in the way - which becomes a battle of wills."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8d5082ddb1b4-love-island-contestants-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eHKsfgDPvyST data-wc=9><strong>The Love Islanders haven't chosen their&nbsp;most compatible partners</strong></p><p id=esFe-x7BYHpy data-wc=37>The intimacy expert continued that if they can get past their breakup and arguments, they "could have a long-lasting relationship," which is likely not what their current partners Luca Bish or Paige Thorne would want to hear!</p><p id=eBx_E_oI9NBb data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Who is Love Island bombshell Jacques?" class=hm-link href=#>Who is Love Island bombshell Jacques?</a></strong></p><p id=egYnYsFXYgUI data-wc=1><strong>SHOP:&nbsp;<a aria-label="14 best Love Island gift ideas for the ultimate fan: From the NEW gold water bottle for 2022 to the summer party essentials" class=hm-link href=#>14 best Love Island gift ideas: From the NEW gold water bottle&nbsp;to&nbsp;summer party essentials</a></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Paige Thorne</h2><p id=ebrcLMdg1tfo data-wc=50>It's rare that couples who form connections in the first week or so remain together for the entire series – after all, bombshells and Casa Amor are there to test their relationships. However, Welsh paramedic Paige may already be in the perfect coupling with Jacques based on their star signs.&nbsp;</p><p id=e6PTvT9bx9_R data-wc=54>"As a couple, Jacques and Paige (a Virgo) could have a lot in common, be devoted, romantic and patient with one another. Yet, to have an easy ride this season, they’ll have to watch out for Jacque's stubbornness or Paige's overanalysis of others and learn not to take each other too seriously," Stephanie explained.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Remi Lambert</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/642b363b83cb-remi-and-jay-fist-bump-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e9KZ7zvPKTC_ data-wc=8><strong>Remi is more compatible with Paige&nbsp;than Indiyah</strong></p><p id=eDgpXZjrT18h data-wc=32>Newcomer Remi, however, could step on Jacque's toes since he is "incredibly compatible" with Paige, Stephanie revealed. And based on their flirty dinner date on Wednesday night's episode, she could be right!</p><p id=eJ1EbgOnGKxR data-wc=46>"Remi, a Virgo from Manchester, shares the same star sign as Paige, which is good news if these two couple up. When two Virgos are in a relationship, they’re incredibly compatible thanks to their excellent communication, romantic tendencies and reasonable, logical and enthusiastic abilities," she said.</p><p id=ejcSXmtsK1FJ data-wc=25>The model and rapper has so far expressed an interest in Indiyah Polack – which Stephanie said doesn't make sense based on their star signs.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Gemma Owen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b0c659af65ca-gemma-calls-luca-jacques-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eVc3uRb8TVUJ data-wc=12><strong>Gemma recently called her current partner Luca Bish by her ex's name</strong></p><p id=eItJigrTeMFA data-wc=18>Although Remi didn't choose Gemma as one of his three lunch dates, they could "form a great relationship."</p><p id=eNNAoDASMbHG data-wc=69>"More bad news for Jacques (even more for Luca) is if Remi takes a shine to Gemma. Like Paige and Jacques (a Taurus and Virgo), the model and the dressage rider could form a great relationship if they give each other a chance as they’ve got lots in common and plenty of patience," the expert said, adding: "Two Islanders his star sign isn't aligned with are Indiyah and Tasha."</p><p id=etqu2DcmgQjq data-wc=27>Only the next few weeks will reveal whether these predictions will come true, but one thing's for sure, we can't wait for the next fire pit gathering.</p><p id=egREMERpKpQ9 data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Love Island star Davide's family speak out against 'desperate' Ekin-Su&nbsp;" class=hm-link href=#>Love Island star Davide's family speak out against 'desperate' Ekin-Su&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p id=e-42hzIpKtVX data-wc=25><strong>Planning your wedding?
