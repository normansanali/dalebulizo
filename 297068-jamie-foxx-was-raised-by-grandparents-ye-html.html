Maybe they weren't ready to raise a child. Was it too inconvenient? I lived just up the street from them. I'll never understand it because I know how great it feels to have a child love you back."</p><p class=dh>Foxx's grandmother played a crucial role in shaping him into one of the most prominent figures today. When he won his Oscar Award in 2005 at the 77th Academy Awards, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/077-1/>revealed</a> in his acceptance speech that she was his "first acting teacher," adding:</p><p class=dh>"She told me, 'Stand up straight.

He also revealed that his grandma would give him a hiding whenever he became mischievous:</p><p class=dh>"When I would act the fool, she would beat me. She would whup me. And she could get an Oscar for the way she whupped me because she was great at it."</p><p class=dh>The Texas native said that after Estelle gave him a beating, she would tell him why she did it, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/077-1/>saying</a>, "I want you to be a southern gentleman."</p><p class=dh>Foxx said he learned a lot from his grandparent, who believed he could make something of himself. "She just viewed the world differently.

"Any gaps – emotional gaps, spiritual gaps – my adopted parents filled them. So, I didn't skip a beat. I was never short on the love of a mother and a father, though it came from an earlier generation of the family."</p><p class=dh>Estelle and Mark were present at every one of their grandchild's sporting activities and were his consistent cheerleaders.</p><p class=dh>Despite living close by, Foxx's dad never made it to his school games, and again, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gu.org/stories/test-story/>wondered</a> why: "I was puzzled. Why couldn't he drive 28 miles to check on a son who passed a football more than 1,000 yards?"</p><p class=dh>Estelle was an attentive grandparent who noticed that her grandchild was bright. "She saw me reading early, saw I was smart, and believed I was born to achieve truly special things," Foxx <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gu.org/stories/test-story/>recalled</a>.</p><p class=dh>The comedian <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,995428,00.html>divulged</a> that his "grandmother was a confident woman" and "knew who she was." He added, along with the "love" she and his grandfather showered him with, "she passed on that confidence."</p><p class=dh>The triple threat revealed that Estelle was 60 years old when she adopted him. She had her own business, ran a daycare at her home, and had a library.</p><p class=dh>During an appearance on "The Late Late Show with James Corden," Foxx <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPoqpZSK--k">described</a> his grandmother as a "tough" woman who always told people in the neighborhood that "he is special."</p><p class=dh>She also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPoqpZSK--k">stood</a> up for him when people made life difficult for him. The biggest takeaway for Foxx was that parents need to be able to "go all the way for your kids."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Reconciling with Parents for the Sake of the Family</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In 2020, Foxx appeared in the film, "Just Mercy," which is about a young attorney (Michael B. Jordan) who travels to Alabama to defend a man (Foxx) wrongfully convicted of murder.</p><p class=dh>The storyline hit too close to home for the singer as his father, Darrel, was imprisoned for seven years for being in possession of illegal substances.

Foxx wrote to his biological parent that things were going well for him and that he would rescue him once he got released. After that, Darrell moved in with his son. The Golden Globe Award winner revealed in July 2020 that Darell had been living with him for two decades.</p><p class=dh>His mother, Louise, also decided to move in with them.
