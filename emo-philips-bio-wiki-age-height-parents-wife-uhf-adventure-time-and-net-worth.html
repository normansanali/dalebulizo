UHF was a 1989 American comedy film starring “Weird Al” Yankovic, Kevin McCarthy, David Bowe, Emo Philips, Anthony Geary, Fran Drescher, Victoria Jackson, Michael Richards, Stanley Brock, Gedde Watanabe, Billy Barty, and Trinidad Silva; the film is devoted to Silva, who died shortly after filming wrapped.</p><p>The film was directed by Jay Levey, Yankovic’s manager, who also co-wrote the screenplay with him. The film was initially released by Orion Pictures and is presently acknowledged by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.</p><p>Yankovic and Levey struggled to find a show company to finance the film but were ultimately able to get Orion’s support after noting they could keep the film costs under $5 million. Principal photography took place around Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p><p>Yankovic stars as George Newman, a shiftless dreamer who slips into organizing a low-budget television station and, surprisingly, finds victory with his eclectic programming options, spearheaded by the antics of a janitor-turned-children’s television host, Stanley Spadowski (Richards).</p><p>He initiates the ire of a major network station that dislikes the competitive upstart. The title refers to the ultra-high frequency (UHF) analog television broadcasting band on which such low-budget television stations were often placed in the United States. Yankovic and Levey wrote the film after Yankovic’s second studio album and chose the approach of George having a vivid imagination to support the inclusion of parodies within the film.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=emo-philips-miami-vice></span><span id=Emo_Philips_Miami_Vice>Emo Philips Miami Vice</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Philips starred as Rat Race Contestant in Miami Vice.

The USA Network started circulating reruns in 1988 and broadcast an initially unaired episode during its syndication run of the series on January 25, 1990.</p><p>Unlike standard police procedurals, the show drew laboriously upon 1980s New Wave culture and is stated for its integration of contemporary pop and rock music and stylish or stylized visuals. People magazine says that Miami Vice was the “first show to look really new and different since color TV was invented”.</p><h2 id=h-emo-philips-judy-tenuta><span class=ez-toc-section id=emo-philips-judy-tenuta></span><span id=Emo_Philips_Judy_Tenuta>Emo Philips Judy Tenuta</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Philips paid honor to comedian Judy Tenuta by communicating his favorite story regarding her after the news of the latter’s death broke.

The series is based on a 2007 short film that circulated on Nicktoons.</p><p>After the short became a viral hit on the Internet, Nickelodeon’s executives passed on its choice before Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series from Fred Seibert and Ward, which was previewed on March 11, 2010. The same year, the series premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5 and finished its eight-year run on September 3, 2018.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=emo-philips-movies-and-tv-shows></span><span id=Emo_Philips_Movies_and_Tv_Shows>Emo Philips Movies and Tv Shows</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Emo Philips Live</li><li>UHF 1989</li><li>Journey to the Center of the Earth 1989</li><li>Meet the Parents 1992</li><li>The Weird Al Show 1997</li></ul><ul><li>Slacker Cats 2007 – 2009</li><li>Desperation Boulevard 1998</li><li>The Aristocrats 2005</li><li>Welcome to the Wayne 2014 – 2019</li><li>Ed Byrne’s Just for Laughs Since 2004</li></ul><ul><li>Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe 2020</li><li>Weird: The Al Yankovic Story 2010</li><li>Dying Laughing 2016</li><li>Negligee and Underpants Party</li><li>The Seventh Python 2008</li></ul><ul><li>Original Max Talking Headroom Show Hunky Boys Go Ding-Dong</li><li>The Secret Policeman’s Ball</li><li>Under the Smogberry Trees</li><li>Stalking Emo</li></ul><ul><li>American Dirtbags</li><li>Rise of the Kitchen Appliances</li><li>Stand Up America Since 2003</li><li>The Can Man Vendors 2019</li></ul><h2 id=h-emo-philips-awards-and-achievements><span class=ez-toc-section id=emo-philips-awards-and-achievements></span><span id=Emo_Philips_Awards_and_Achievements>Emo Philips Awards and Achievements</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Philips was awarded the New Music Award for ‘E=mo2’, declared the year’s best comedy album</p><h2 id=h-frequently-asked-questions-about-emo-philips><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-emo-philips></span><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_Emo_Philips><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions_About_XYZ_H2_and_Centered>Frequently Asked Questions About Emo Philips</span></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Emo Philips?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Emo Philips is an American writer, stand-up comedian, actor, and producer.
