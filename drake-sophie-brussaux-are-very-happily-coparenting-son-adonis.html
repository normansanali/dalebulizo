Drake and Sophie Brussaux are loving life with their 3-year-old son, Adonis.
The toddler’s parents “are very happily coparenting together in Toronto with both of them sharing custody,” a source exclusively tells Us Weekly. “Adonis is a very happy little boy.”
The little one arrived in October 2017, and the rapper, 34, confirmed his paternity in June of the following year in his song “March 14.”
The Grammy winner waited to address Brussaux’s birth despite Pusha T rapping about it in “The Story of Adidon” because he was waiting on a DNA test, Drake explained during a December 2019 “Rap Radar” podcast episode."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I knew, for me, it was over at that point. It wasn’t even about battle rap.”</p><p>While the <a href=#>Degrassi</a> alum initially kept his baby boy’s face off of social media, he <a href=#>shared photos of Adonis for the first time</a> in March. “I love and miss my beautiful family and friends and I can’t wait for the joyful day when we are all able to reunite,” the Canada native captioned an Instagram slideshow at the time.</p><p>The American Music Award winner also showed <a href=#>Adonis heading off to school</a> and <a href=#>celebrating his birthday</a> in September and October, respectively.</p><p>“Three years ago, I was finally meeting you for the first time, after a long 24-our labor,” Brussaux, 31, gushed via Instagram while sharing party pics. “I’m so proud of the little man you’re becoming, I love you more than life. The world is YOURS! We did that @champagnepapi.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>With reporting by Nicholas Hautman</p><p><strong>For more hot celebrity news, listen to Us Weekly editors dish on top topics & trends with these clips from the Hot Hollywood Podcast!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGadqpGgsm6%2Fzqmfop1dl7%2B2v9KarLFlkaeybsLEq7BmoJGlvaq42GaaqKiRp7KvwMinnmarn6N6orDOp6CsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
