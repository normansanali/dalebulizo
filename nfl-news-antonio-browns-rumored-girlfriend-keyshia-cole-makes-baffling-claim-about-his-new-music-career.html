You could say he is one of the most famous NFL players amongst players not called the quarterback. And now he’s out with a new music album. Well recently, Keyshia Cole, the rapper and singer who features on AB’s album Paradigm, sang praises of the Super Bowl Champ. The singer cum TV personality even went on to say that Antonio Brown could win the coveted Grammy award.</p><p>While talking to TMZ Sports, the singer was replying to the question about AB being able to win a Grammy. To which Keyshia Cole immediately remarks, “Of Course! Anybody… ..what you mean? Yeah! Whatever you do, you put your mind to it. You can choose to do whatever you want in life.”</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/AB-Raiders.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The singer also noted that AB has what it takes to make it in the music industry. She said, “I think he’s really talented. I love the body of work he’s created. I think he’s going to be great. Wouldn’t have collaborated if I didn’t think he was great.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Antonio Brown Doesn’t Need To Give up On Ballin’</h2><p>When asked if AB should hang up his boots and take up music full time, Cole refused to agree. She said, “I don’t think he should give up on anything… ..Hell No. Why?” And rightfully so, if a team picks AB up, he can definitely play the season, and make music in the off season.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-nfl-news-antonio-brown-goes-full-ab-mode-in-new-album-as-he-reveals-more-on-tom-brady-retirement-the-money-he-was-owed?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago1027162590h.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Antonio Brown Goes Full AB Mode in New Album As He Reveals More on Tom Brady Retirement & The Money He Was Owed</p></a><p>Keyshia Cole has been seen with Antonio Brown on many of his promotional events. Notably, has had a successful singing career of her own and ranked atop the charts in her hay-day. Along with AB, she has featured on the song, Don’t Leave. Consequently, they have a hit song together. While their chemistry has made the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>news</a> already, the two were also seen at Floyd Mayweather’s Party.</p><p>Whether or not Antonio Brown wins a Grammy, is immaterial to the success he has made off the field. Until last to last off season, the narrative around Antonio Brown was completely different. In contrast,&nbsp; today the NFL world talks about his music, his creative output. Irrespective of whether it is good or bad, it is much better than his indulgences in the past. Additionally, as AB refers to in his <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>song</a>, “Pit not the Palace,” he’s setting up a good example for his children.</p><p>By reaching atop one profession, and trying his hardest to maintain the hundred things that have to go right for you to perform at that level, he has not pivoted to something completely different. Which is something completely new. Furthermore, he is again putting in the work. The results are mostly never in the hands of the actor anyways.</p><p>Watch this story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Three Landing Spots Emerge For Troubled 49ers WR Deebo Samuel</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82fo2amlazAbq3NraanoZ9ir7O71qeqZqqloryzscNmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWSknamotaqtjJympZ1doq6ssdJmmZqelqG2r7OMnKOaoZ1irqO71K1koaGjYrumw4ymrKyhk2Kwor7Enqlo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
