“God knew what our heart desired and in His perfect timing, blessed us with a growing baby,” the former reality star, 33, said in a statement. “After a season of death and loss in both of our families, (we lost 3 grandfathers in less than six months), this blessing of life really felt like God showing us, ‘Hey, I’m with you,’ and illustrating the circle of life."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

God doesn’t waste your pain. The last thing I was able to tell my grandfather before he went to heaven in March was that we were having a baby!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cortney-Hendrix-Is-Pregnant-Expecting-1st-Child-With-Husband-Sherm-001.jpg><p>The North Carolina native gushed about showing her late grandfather her pregnancy test over FaceTime seven weeks into her pregnancy. (The former Lifetime personality is now nearing her 15th week.)</p><p>“As long as I can remember, I’ve dreamt of being a mother,” the expectant star went on to tell Us. “I didn’t really know if it was going to happen for me naturally because of <a href=#>endometriosis</a>. It was a fear I’ve always had in the back of my head and voiced it often to my friends and family. Seeing two pink lines was the most joyous and terrifying moment. I immediately cried and we just hugged each other. A few minutes later, I heard Sherm in the other room. I went in and saw him down on his hands and knees, praying and thanking God for this miracle. I’m so thankful he is my husband, and I cannot wait for this journey with him.”</p><p>Hendrix and Sherm tied the knot in October 2020, one year after she<a href=#> filed for divorce</a> from her MAFS costar<a href=#> <strong>Jason Carrion</strong></a>. The former couple were married for five years, announcing their split in a March 2019 Instagram post.</p><p>“We have decided together to move on in different paths, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have love for each other,” Hendrix wrote at the time. “He will always have a special place in my heart and life. We do love you all and appreciate the support that you have shown us from the beginning.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since moving on with Sherm, the professional dancer has been showing off their relationship via Instagram, from throwback wedding shots to family photos with their dog, Queso.</p><p>“God is good and I’m so thankful for a Godly man to share this life with,” Hendrix wrote via Instagram in November 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGammZaoeqS70a2lnrFdnbKvsNGir2aoopq0r63NrWSesKCasLW1zaBkaqukYrCptcudZLChpJ16tLTEq6Ro</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
