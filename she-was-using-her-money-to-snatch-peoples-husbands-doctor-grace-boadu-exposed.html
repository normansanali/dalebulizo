After school he made me learn hairdressing. he also sponsored my education. So as you can see, I will be happy in the marriage”.</p><p>This contradicts the statement by her supposed uncle, who, in an interview with Poleeno Multimedia said “Oh, Doctor does not have a child. She was now looking forward to getting married and giving birth and that is even the part that pains the family a lot”.</p><p>Reacting to this, Ghanaians are finding it very difficult to understand whether the Doctor, whilst alive married or not.</p><p>Meanwhile, a netizen has said that the supposed teacher Doctor Grace Boadu talked about in her interview with Emelia Brobbey is someone’s husband.</p><p>According to the netizen, the man is married with 3 kids but Doctor Grace Boadu was using her wealth to be a home wrecker.</p><p>A netizen wrote: “[The man] was not her husband. She was using her money to take him from his wife and 3 kids”.</p><p>“All that she was saying was more of an attack than truth, her family is right,” another said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by thosecalledcelebs (@thosecalledcelebs)</a></p></figure><p>The popular herbalist was reported dead when dusk was falling yesterday, January 29, 2024.</p><p>The news of her sudden death was made known by the popular Kumasi-based television station, Kessben Television, via their official social media platforms.</p><p>Taking to their social media pages, Kessben Television posted a picture of pulchritudinous Doctor Grace Boadu and captioned it “Tomorrow is never promised.
