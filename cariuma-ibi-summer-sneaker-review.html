I've shared about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>my non-existent dating life</a>! I've openly written about how I overcame my frustrations with my fine, thin hair — all thanks to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>a Jennifer Aniston-approved trick</a> that's a total game changer. And maybe you know this, or maybe you don't yet, but I sweat — a lot. Hey, there's no such thing as TMI here.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Given the fact that I'm prone to excess perspiration, I'm always very careful about what I wear, especially during the summer months. I actively avoid reaching for anything that shows sweat marks, like silk tops or gray tees, and I won't be caught dead in shoes that technically aren't warm weather-friendly, like leather boots. Breathable, lightweight pieces take priority, and that's exactly why I've been living in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">one particular pair of slip-on sneakers</a> from Cariuma. (In case you also didn't know, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>I'm a Cariuma stan</a>.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I'd recommend any shoe from the brand's vast assortment (they all are amazing, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>just ask my mom</a>!), I 100 percent suggest getting the brand's IBI Slip-Ons right now, because they're a light-as-feather sneaker that's perfect for anyone who gets sweaty feet (like me) in summer heat and humidity.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $98; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">cariuma.com</a></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $98; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">cariuma.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I know, I know: You're probably wondering what makes them different from other slip-ons you've tried. Unlike your typical cotton Vans or Converse, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the IBI is designed with a knit upper</a> that's made from a mix of bamboo and recycled plastics. Not only is this material feather-light and breathable — a major game changer for my sweaty feet — but it's also incredibly comfy, so much so that it provides a sock-like fit. Love! And before you ask, no, I don't wear socks with these. I'll get to that in a moment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The IBI comes with a removable, cushioned insole made from sustainably harvested cork and mamona oil — the keyword here being removable, which means that if your sweaty feet tend to make the inside of your shoes smelly, fret not because this one can be replaced. I haven't needed to swap out the original insole just yet, but at the end of the summer, I'll likely get a few replacements to have on hand for next season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The removable insole is one reason I feel comfortable enough to go sockless — and don't have to worry about my sweaty feet ruining my shoes for good — but the other reason I can nix socks altogether is because <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">these slip-ons are machine washable</a>. Stinky feet? I don't know them. I haven't needed to throw mine in the washer just yet, but I know by the end of the summer, I will.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for how they rank in the comfort department? On a scale of one to 10, these are an easy 15. Translation: They're incredibly easy on my feet. In fact, I've worn them for eight-hour-long days, which were spent mostly on my feet, and didn't want to throw them off the second I got home. (Yes, I've had that reaction to shoes before.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">TL;DR: If you're prone to sweaty feet or simply want a pair of easy summer sneakers, the IBI Slip-Ons are for you. Shop them below and thank me later.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $98; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">cariuma.com</a></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $98; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">cariuma.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3y0tM6eqmibkae2trnAZqCboV2owq65xKtkrKaVlrimvoyrnK%2Bhlaw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
