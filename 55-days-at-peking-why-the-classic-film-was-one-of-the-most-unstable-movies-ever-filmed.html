Eventually, the remaining 1,200 Chinese extras required by the script ended up being discovered and flown in from countries like Great Britain, Italy, France, and Portugal, according to the Flying-Dutchman.</p><p dir=ltr>But it wasn't just finding extras that proved to be a problem — the position of director proved difficult to fill. The original director of the film was Nicholas Ray of "Rebel Without a Cause" fame. However, Ray collapsed and suffered a heart attack halfway through filming, per <a href=#>Slant Magazine</a>. Though Ray's substance abuse likely played a role, it was rumored that the strain of dealing with the cursed "55 Days at Peking" production had played a part. In fact, some Hollywood insiders claimed the heart attack was coupled with a nervous breakdown and Ray had consistently "not [showed] up" to work, per <a href=#>The A.V. Club</a>.</p><p>Whatever the truth, Ray was replaced — by both Guy Green and then by Andrew Marten (via <a href=#>IMDb</a>). With consistently shifting crew members, filming was never going to be easy. However, few could have predicted that a woman once considered the ultimate Hollywood icon would prove to be an even bigger obstacle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j2ttcGljZIJ2ecOasKxlkal6sbHKoqWgZaedxm7Ax55knKSRqMCqr4yfoKWlXayutHnOp5xmp5ZiwamxjKamrKxdqru0wMCbo55lnaTDqrHSZpyvnaJis6q4zJ6baA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
