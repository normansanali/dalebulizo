If anyone wants to remember Prine in his prime days, this is the one song they should listen to.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Hello In There</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>The same year, Prine released the single "Hello In There." Another classic he would go on to sing many times over the years. Most recently, he performed the song on "Live from Sessions at West 54th."</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Angel from Montgomery</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Another fan-favorite from 1971 was "Angel from Montgomery." This song of dreams and hope was another hit. Prine performed it back in October 2018 for the "Austin City Limits" show.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Souvenirs</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Prine's collection wasn't without its share of musical romantic ballads. In 1972, he released the song called "Souvenirs." The upbeat tune is best performed with a guitar in hand, which Prine did back in 2016.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Storm Windows</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>To start the '80s, Prine released another top track, "Storm Windows." In it, he talks about staying away from the cold. "Don't let your baby down," goes the chorus.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Summer's End</strong></h3></p><p class=dh>Prine took a break from making music, only to come back in 2018 with new songs. Among them was the hit, "Summer's End," which spoke about coming home.</p><p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Tour postponement</strong></h3></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2019/07/24/john-prine-undergo-surgery-postpones-concerts/1821028001/>Last July</a>, the singer and songwriter experienced a setback when he had to reschedule tour dates to have surgery. He was reportedly at a high risk of stroke.</p><p class=dh>In total, eight dates were affected. What was important, though, was that the star could later return to living his life doing what he loves. We send condolences out to his family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtna3BmbXqru8enZKmqmaOytHnBnqqtZaOku6h5y7KpopujYq6tuIytoKado2O1tbnL</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
