For example, they have been the main battery power management IC (PMIC) provider for Samsung mobile devices for the better part of the last decade (And until recent years, a lot of other phone-centric PMICs as well).</p><p>Although the two companies have some overlapping product segments which likely will see consolidation, the overall two business seem like they will be complementary to each other as they both specialize in different areas. Analog Devices in particular says that the transaction is meant to boost its market share in the automotive and data centre markets thanks to Maxim’s application specific products, while continuing to offer Analog Devices own broader market products.</p><p>In a market where we see a ton of consolidation and many vendors opting to vertically integrate their solutions, it becomes important to have a broader product portfolio in order to maintain leadership positions. The new consolidated Analog Devices and Maxim Integrated entity will have the breadth to compete against big players such as Texas Instruments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH52hY9wZpqmkaG8qHnDnq2im5WoerW7jJussmWdlsWquYyfpqtlYmavrw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
