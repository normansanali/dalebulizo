A frantic search is underway to determine what happened. Theories include an explosive decompression that would have killed the pilot and all four tourists on board, damage to the submersible that would have stranded Titan somewhere on the ocean floor, or most optimistically, some kind of error that would have stranded it somewhere on the surface with no way to call for help.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>If Titan is still underwater and the passengers are still alive, they have around <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">12 hours of oxygen</a> left at the time of this writing and potentially no working lights. This is obviously a terrible predicament for the passengers, and for those trying to rescue them, who are searching an area twice the size of Connecticut that involves depths of up to 2.5 miles.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>Plus, the only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">manned craft that could reach Titan</a> would merely be able to pinpoint its location, as it’s impossible to transfer individuals between crafts at such a low depth.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>Given these dire circumstances, OceanGate should probably restructure the PR team that has allowed this job ad to stay posted — especially since it contains verbiage that could be construed as seeking to replace the currently missing pilot.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=false>Throw in that OceanGate’s reputation is already suffering from Titan’s technical details becoming known, including that it’s built from off-the-shelf components and has been piloted via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a third-party Xbox controller</a>, and you have a company that might not even be around in a few months to onboard its new employees.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeVq7KvwNJoppydkaO0osDEZq6hoZOderDDzaxkraCVYrqqv9KipaBlpJ7BorqMrKybpZWnwKquy55koZmjYq6vec6moKenpai5unnWqKmdnZRit7CujJqbZqSfpLiqusZmnaiqXaOyuHnPoqOorKNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
