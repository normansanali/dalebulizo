While most TikTokers who rise on the app <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">become sought-after stars</a> in their own right, there are few people out there who actually desire an in-person meeting with the Repo Reaper.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-the-repo-reaper data-injectable=false>Who is the Repo Reaper?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true><a title=@thereapersecpage href=#>@thereapersecpage</a><p>DONT BE MAD AT ME IM JUST DOING MY Job <a title=thereporeaper href=#>#thereporeaper</a> <a title=tiktok href=#>#tiktok</a> <a title=fyp„Ç∑ href=#>#fyp„Ç∑</a> <a title=audi href=#>#audi</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ SHAKE SUMN - DaBaby" href=#>‚ô¨ SHAKE SUMN ‚Äì DaBaby</a></figure><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>TikTok‚Äôs Repo Reaper refers to user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@only1reporeaper</a> ‚Äì whose account was recently deactivated. It was suspended, according to the Reaper himself, due to some kind of account violation. Even without access to his original videos, however, plenty of Repo Reaper TikTok videos continue to litter the web, thanks to reposts and stitches with other creators. He also created an alternate account ‚Äî @thereapersecpage ‚Äî where he continues to post near-daily videos of his day-to-day.</p><p data-characters=594 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>And that day-to-day is surprisingly entertaining. The MO of the Repo Reaper‚Äôs account is quite straightforward, and apparently fits perfectly into the niche many TikTokers never knew they needed. His videos almost exclusively follow the Reaper‚Äôs job, which sees him travel around his city repossessing cars following late car payments. Recording himself as he works, the Reaper has earned a reputation for dancing, doing pushups, and bopping along to music ‚Äî typically DaBaby‚Äôs ‚ÄúSHAKE SUMN‚Äù ‚Äî as he carefully maneuvers repossessed vehicles onto his tow truck.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@thereapersecpage href=#>@thereapersecpage</a><p>THE Repo Reaper did it üòà <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=tiktok href=#>#tiktok</a> <a title=repoman href=#>#repoman</a> <a title=viralvideo href=#>#viralvideo</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=repost href=#>#repost</a> <a title=message href=#>#message</a> <a title=to href=#>#to</a> <a title=my href=#>#my</a> <a title=fans href=#>#fans</a> this is my second account <a title=repost href=#>#repost</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ SHAKE SUMN - DaBaby" href=#>‚ô¨ SHAKE SUMN ‚Äì DaBaby</a></figure><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>In the wake of his broad TikTok virality, the Repo Reaper has become a meme, of sorts. TikTokers now joke about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the anxiety of hearing</a> ‚ÄúSHAKE SUMN‚Äù in the background, and fearing that their car is about to be repossessed, or about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hiding their cars</a> in elaborate locations to avoid the Reaper‚Äôs arrival.</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=false>Some of his videos get extra attention due to the presence of car owners in the background. Occasionally, when the Reaper comes to collect, vehicle owners are close enough to catch him in the act, and often <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">attempt to stall his work</a>. Their outrage ‚Äî in the background of his videos ‚Äî is a humorous addition to the videos, but one that causes mass anxiety in many car owners. It‚Äôs all fun and games to laugh at someone else‚Äôs misfortune, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">don‚Äôt laugh too hard</a> ‚Äî someday the Reaper may come knocking at your door.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTOZqCsZaSeuLW7yqxkq52gpHqzscCpnKtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
