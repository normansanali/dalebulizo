You know it's even worse when the husband quotes lyrics from the wife's song. But that's exactly what Kroy Biermann has resorted to. Biermann has edited his <a href=#>Instagram</a> bio to include: "My ring meant a thing." Biermann, of course, plucked the line from Kim&nbsp;Zolciak's song "The Ring Didn't Mean A&nbsp;Thing,"&nbsp;which she released as a follow-up to her single, <a href=#>"Tardy for the Party."&nbsp;</a></p><p>Biermann hasn't offered any additional context, so it's fair game to speculate about his intent. But based on what we know, it's likely not a flattering ode to their marriage. Zolciak's song was about a woman who realized, in hindsight, that her significant other only proposed to pacify her. In the song, Zolciak sings, "You bought me a ring to shut me up / Just so you could keep sleeping 'round and cutting up / I don't even know what it cost but it's not enough"&nbsp;(via <a href=#>Genius</a>). Could Biermann be suggesting that Zolciak strung him along? We'll know soon enough.</p><p>Amid the news, Biermann's former boss, Andy Cohen, spoke out about the divorce.&nbsp;"Texted a little bit with Kim yesterday, sent my condolences because it's a sad thing,"&nbsp;Cohen revealed on SiriusXM's "<a href=#>Radio Andy</a>."&nbsp;"They have kids and that was just a couple that seemed very much in love," he added.&nbsp;<a href=#>Bethenny Frankel</a>, however,&nbsp;was far less supportive. Who's shocked?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampoZoJ0hI6kqaixXZe2pr7MmqWnZaOdrqWx0maioqVdr7ytr8iaomaboq69tbXCZqCnq6SWtLOtzGasqZyRqbJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
