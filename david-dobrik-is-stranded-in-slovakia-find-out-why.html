In an update on his Instagram Story on Wednesday (September 22), David said he was having issues with his ID that would allow him to re-enter the country after his trip to Europe with friends.
“Hi guys, sorry I haven’t been too active on social media. Everyone went back home because this is taking way longer and it’s a lot harder than I thought it was getting my visa and green card,” he said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He’s also a recipient of DACA, the immigration policy which allows children of undocumented immigrants to live in the US and avoid deportation. They can get approval to leave the country for various reasons, but there is a certain amount of risk because it does not guarantee admission back.</p><p>He previously announced that he had gotten a green card, which would allow him to exit and enter the country freely without the government approval required for DACA recipients.</p><p>“This like a f–king scavenger hunt, so I’m apologizing because I can’t get any vlogs up or anything. I hope to return to the States soon. It’s like I’m lost. I’m literally stranded. Wish me luck,” he said.</p><p>Earlier in the summer, he <a href=#>had a star-studded birthday celebration.</a></p><p></p><p><span>Just Jared on Facebook</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tonJGrtqV5w6iZq6GbYra0edKtqZqmlJqxbrXNZqqlp6aWuKqtjJ%2Bgp5xdpMK1edahsGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
