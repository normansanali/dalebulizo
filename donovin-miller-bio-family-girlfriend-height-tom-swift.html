And I think we will see a lot of that throughout ‚Ä¶ the first few episodes of&nbsp;Tom Swift.‚Äù</p><p>According to Donovin, Lino‚Äôs relationship with Tom is put to test in season 1. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of that kind of brotherly love relationship ‚Ä¶ going on, where ‚Ä¶ I think they come to realize that everything isn‚Äôt going to be perfect and all glammed up, and ‚Ä¶ they deal with certain emotional things and traumatic things that need to be addressed but ultimately resolve it in a healthy way that family kind of ends up doing,‚Äù the actor revealed to the entertainment outlet.</p><p>He further shared with Distractify, ‚ÄúLino‚Äôs pretty much primary personal challenge is kind of sort of reminiscent of an identity crisis. On the surface, he is the fun-loving kid who kind of uplifts everyone, keeps everyone grounded, and still has a fun, light charisma about himself, but beneath that there is that sense of longing because he doesn‚Äôt really know where he belongs.‚Äù</p><p>As for why he was adopted, Donovin explained, ‚ÄúHe never really questioned it before, but there was always that sense of emptiness within him that he begins to question throughout Season 1 of&nbsp;Tom Swift,&nbsp;and he does some very fun and explorative things to discover where he comes from and why everything ended up the way it did‚Äù.</p><h3><strong>Donovin Miller Career</strong></h3><p>Donovin Miller started his career as a child model.
