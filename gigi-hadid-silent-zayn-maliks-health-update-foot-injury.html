At one point, a slow-moving car appears to run over his foot as the crowd made it hard for Zayn to maneuver. The singer kept a calm look on his face throughout the encounter, though he appeared to be slightly limping before his team was able to escort him to his waiting vehicle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans questioned online whether Zayn was okay following the incident, leading the crooner to offer a brief but reassuring update online.</p><p>“@kenzo @nigo Thanks for a great show.

Thanks to my incredibly well made shoes,” Zayn wrote on Instagram alongside a carousel of images.</p><p>The first photo showed a side image of Zayn in a blue and black patterned jacket, presumable from the night he attended Kenzo’s fashion show and had his foot run over.

One picture showed Khai dressed in a hot pink snow suit with a leopard print hat keeping her warm.

The high-profile couple, both well-known figures in the fashion and music industries, briefly separated in 2018 but reconciled in 2019. In September 2020, Gigi and Zayn celebrated the arrival of their first child, a daughter whose name they revealed as Khai in January 2021.</p><p>However, they broke up the following year after an alleged incident between Zayn and Gigi’s mother Yolando Hadid, for which he later plead no contest to charges from. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gigi is currently dating Bradley Cooper</a>, while Zayn hasn’t been romantically linked to anyone recently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGieop%2BZYrWisMidZKyhnJq7tXnZmrCnZZ2Wuaq30mafnpmcqbVuwc%2BdmK2dXZu8sMCMoqWjraKufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
