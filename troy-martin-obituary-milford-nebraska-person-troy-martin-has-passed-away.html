His family makes this notification. The earth bid farewell to a magnificent human being that day, and heaven welcomed the most extraordinary angel. Born on May 1, 1975, Troy’s young existence was jam-packed with thrilling adventures. Except for periods when he had to travel for work, Troy was a proud lifelong resident of Stellarton (Stellarock).</p><p>Despite his many interests,&nbsp;Being outside was a source of immense joy for him. There was a bond between him and the river and the forest. His infectious enthusiasm for nature was on full display at all of his favorite places, from the family cabin on Caribou Island to his beloved hunting camp in Lovat and beyond. Some of the things that kept him going were gardening, camping, fishing, hunting, foraging for shellfish, playing frisbee, bonfires, and beachcombing. In his spare time, he would go fishing or hunting.</p><p>On top of that, Troy was a master chef who never passed up an opportunity to feed the individuals who meant the most to him. The flavor would be identical whether he cooked the most beautiful gourmet dishes or came up with something totally new. In 1998, Troy enrolled at a culinary school in Port Hawkesbury, motivated by his father’s passion for food. A path that benefited not only himself but also the others he cared about.&nbsp;Troy chose to seek out new career opportunities as his interests shifted and the West beckoned.</p><p>He was an esteemed member of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters (Scaffold) in both Local 1325 and Local 83. Over the course of his career, he worked with people he considered more like family than colleagues. These people may be found all around the nation. Their whole focus and love went into caring for Troy, the first child of Owen and Carol (Humphreys) Martin. His beloved best buddy and sibling, Darren, came into his life two years later.</p><p>Furthermore, his grandma’s passing leaves his maternal grandmother, Keddy Humphreys, whom he had affectionately called “the biggest part of his heart,” to grieve. There was a solid bond between them, and they kept in constant contact. The presence of his niece Brieanna Martin (Jake McInnis), two nephews William and Owen, and numerous more blessings were bestowed upon him. Furthermore, Troy is running away from his fiancée Heather MacKenzie, whom he calls “the love of his life,” and the October wedding arrangements they had previously set.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwwNGosGalkafBqrqMqJmirKWWv7p5zKKjn6eimXqvscGrmKyjkWK9pr7SqKVmrKKkxm65wKuroqZdna60ec%2BaqqydlGKuuK3YaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
