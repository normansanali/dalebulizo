Leading up to the eviction ceremony, the 21-year-old worked alongside his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in-house girlfriend</a>, America Lopez, to flip the vote from Felicia to Izzy, ultimately betraying one of his closest allies and leading to her elimination — poor Izzy!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Izzy-Gleicher-Cirie-Fields-Big-Brother.png><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Parade</a>, Izzy reflected on some of her controversial comments, both after her eviction and before, revealing that a majority of them “probably should have never happened.”</p><p>“When I got the ‘Piggy Pals’ punishment, I was like, ‘who’s the pig in the house? I’ve got to pick Cameron,’ so we had done been known that, but I knew Cameron was coming after me for weeks, probably from day one. He was feeling threatened by the fact that I was not threatened by him, and so I knew that about him. We never were able to find common ground.”</p><p>“Cory, I just felt super super betrayed by, and, for as smart as he is, you’re going to stick with Cameron like that? That doesn’t seem like the smartest move. I felt hurt, [and] I underestimated his relationship with America… The conversation that I will always regret having is the one I had with America. I don’t know if anyone saw this, but she came to me to apologize for telling about Felicia, and I came at her. I shouldn’t have had that conversation with her. That should have waited. That probably should have never happened, and I know that that was ammunition against me, and I regret it wholeheartedly.”</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>While Izzy may be leaving the Big Brother house with some regrets, such as fighting with America and “not being more careful with Cory,” the newly evicted houseguest is leaving with something even more valuable than a massive cash prize: a newfound family.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>In the same interview, Izzy reflected on her oh-so-special relationship with Cirie and Jared Fields, sharing what their relationship was really like in the Big Brother house.</p><p>“I was hoping to find someone that I genuinely connected with, because I knew the house was going to be a scary, lonely place if you let it. I clocked Jared. Before I even saw Cirie, I knew who he was… Even though I am not a big social media person, he’s literally the only family member of a reality person that I know of, and that’s because he makes&nbsp;music&nbsp;and I was curious about it, but I knew who he was, and I wanted to make that connection regardless if I saw Cirie.”</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>With Cirie saying in her goodbye message to Izzy that she will always be invited to the Fields family dinners, it is safe to say that we will be keeping up with the trio on social media as soon as Big Brother 25 comes to a close.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=false>Tune into&nbsp;CBS&nbsp;every&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunday, Wednesday, and Thursday</a>&nbsp;to watch the rest of Big Brother 25 unfold — with a double eviction on the way, things are about to get wild!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMCtZKmqn5euo7jYZqqhp6WhsW60wK%2BcZqaVq7Kzeceap6mdnpqxbrXZs7Bmn5yatqS0xKtknaGjmMK0v8SsZKGdomKwsLrTq6avnaKotqK4jJympqWVo8G0ecCfq56qXZrDqq%2FToqanZZanvK55waKeZpqipMGpsdFmaW5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
