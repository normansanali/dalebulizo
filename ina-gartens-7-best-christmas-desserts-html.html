Before the book was published, she shared on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> that these cookies were one of her <a href=#>all-time favorite</a> treats because “they’re really more like decadent, snack-sized cakes.”</p><p id=par-9_43>“The best part is that they are glazed with both chocolate AND vanilla icing so you don’t have to choose between the two. And, once you’ve had them fresh out of the oven, you’ll never go back to store-bought cookies again!” Garten promised.</p><h2>3. Ginger Shortbread comes in different shapes and sizes</h2><p id=par-10_40>It doesn’t get much easier than Garten’s recipe for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ginger Shortbread</a>. The only tools required are a mixer with the paddle attachment, plastic wrap, and an ungreased baking sheet.

Croissant Bread Pudding was featured in the original ‘Barefoot Contessa’ cookbook</h2><p id=par-12_52>One of the earliest holiday dessert recipes that Garten shared with her fans was her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Croissant Bread Pudding</a> from her first Barefoot Contessa cookbook, which was published in 1999.
