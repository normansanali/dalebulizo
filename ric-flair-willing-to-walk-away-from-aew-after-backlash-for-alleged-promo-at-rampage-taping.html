Many people aren’t happy about his joining AEW and now Flair made it clear he is willing to walk away from the company after he got backlash from an alleged promo during this week’s AEW Rampage taping.</p><p>Ric Flair made his debut on a previous episode of AEW Dynamite, where he was revealed to be Sting’s gift from Tony Khan. Naturally,&nbsp;<a href=#>this was big moment for not only The Nature Boy</a>&nbsp;but others in the company as well.</p><p>Sting and Flair appeared together for a segment on AEW Rampage, where fans in attendance raised a hue and cry on social media for a Ric Flair promo.</p><p>“Flair invited all the women in the audience from ages 18-28 to meet him in his hotel room. No boyfriends or husbands.”</p><p>The Nature Boy took to his Instagram and sent a message to Tony Khan, stating that he said that he is more than willing to walk away if he embarrassed the company, after all the backlash.</p><p>”I Am So Tired Of Hearing All This Negativity! I Don’t Need To Work, And I Don’t Need The Money. Can’t I Simply Enjoy Being By My Dear Friend <a href=#>@stinger</a>’s Side For The Next Few Months Without So Much Hatred? I Know I’m Old, But That Doesn’t Mean I Can’t Enjoy Life! I Have Earned The Right To Do Whatever I Want & I’m Exactly Where I Want To Be! I Appreciate Everything <a href=#>@tonyrkhan</a>, But I’m More Than Willing To Walk Away If I Am Embarrassing You And Your Company. All I Can Say Is I’m Sorry!”</p><p><a href=#>Flair doesn’t advise younger wrestlers</a> for good reason. He is also&nbsp;<a href=#>willing to take a table bump in AEW</a>, so we will have to wait and see how the company will continue to use him in the coming weeks, should he remain with AEW.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed></figure><p>What do you think of what Ric Flair said?
