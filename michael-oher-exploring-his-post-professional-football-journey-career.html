Oher, who was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and had a 2009 movie "The Blind Side" starring Sandra Bullock made about his life story. Yet the actual events that followed after he made a name for himself have been offset by litigation and personal struggle, giving his narrative an air of both success and failure.</p><h2>Early Life and Rise to Fame</h2><p>Michael Oher was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee where he had a very tough upbringing. His life was the basis of the movie “The Blind Side,” which depicted it among 12 children in a household with an addicted mother. Oher's unique athletic gifts landed him at Briarcrest Christian School, where he crossed paths with the Tuohy family, who later took in the then-teenager. In the film, Oher was brought into the Tuohy clan and eventually became a well-rounded NFL tackle after being drafted in 2009 by the Baltimore Ravens.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Career Success and Challenges</h2><p>Oher was a big-name success in the NFL, helping Baltimore make the playoffs as a rookie and win Super Bowl XLVII with the team. He spent the rest of his career playing with the Carolina Panthers until 2017. The man above was later in his final year due to post-concussion syndrome, ending his professional football career. He played eight years in the NFL.</p><h2>Legal Battles and Accusations</h2><p>Oher's legal troubles and personal struggles following his rise to stardom He further contended that he was entitled to a share of the revenue from the film "The Blind Side," which already has generated more than $309 million at theatres. In a court petition filed in August 2014, Oher claimed that the Tuohys were his conservators without him realizing it and charged them with taking business opportunities on his behalf while he received no money from the profits of the movie. The Tuohys countered that Oher sought to "extort" $15 million from them and sued him for damages, claiming that he demanded money from them after his football career was over.</p><h2>What Happened to Michael Oher?</h2><p>Oher retired from the NFL and began speaking as a public figure, and author. In 2024, he published his second book titled "When Your Back’s Against the Wall: Fame, Football and Lifelong Lessons in Resilience". Nevertheless, despite the legal battles and health issues, Oher is still able to do some paid public speaking appearances as he continues to use his story to motivate others in both his books.</p><p>All in all, the Michael Oher "Blind Side" rags-to-riches tale from his troubled youth to NFL stardom has been somewhat derailed along the way with legal complications and personal struggles. Despite the many controversies Oher is currently involved in, he has gone on to speak about his story and provide hope for others through his writings and public speaking that continue with something of a softer side detailing fortitude against all odds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6RforaktMCeo2anmJq%2FbrHXqaOoqpmjtG60yKxkqaejqXqxvs6fnKyrmaS7oriMn6aorJKWua15yaisq6aVrnqkrdGenKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
