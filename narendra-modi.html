The 1st Indian PM to hold this record was Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Moreover, Modi is also the 1st Indian PM from outside the Congress to win both terms with a majority in the Lok Sabha.</p><p>Similarly, Narendra&nbsp;was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001. Later on, he was elected to the legislative assembly as well. People have criticized Modi’s administration for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education.</p><p>The current Indian PM led the BJP in the 2014 general election. This gave the party a majority in the Indian lower house of parliament. His administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy. Modi’s administration has also reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programs.</p><p>Furthermore, the current PM has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy. Modi abolished the Planning Commission and hence centralized power. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign. Narendra also initiated a controversial demonetization of high-denomination banknotes. He eventually weakened or abolished environmental and labor laws.</p><p>Under Prime Minister Modi’s tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding. Modi’s administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir after his party’s victory in the 2019 general election. Moreover, his administration introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act. This resulted in widespread protests across the country.</p><p>Additionally, Modi has become a controversial figure both domestically and internationally. It is due to the prime minister’s Hindu nationalist beliefs.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-135664 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Narendra-Modi-receiving-the-Goalkeepers-Global-Goals-Award-from-Bill-Gates.jpeg alt="Narendra modi" width=650 height=510 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-135664 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Narendra Modi receiving the Goalkeepers Global Goals Award from Bill Gates.
