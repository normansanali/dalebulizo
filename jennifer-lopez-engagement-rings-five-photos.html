Jessica also explains that the marquise solitaire is a particularly special cut and just like JLo, bang on-trend. It has an estimated worth of $100,000 (£80,000).</p><p id=eVE8K16bII9>"[It is] a classic choice and one that was increasingly popular in the 1990s, symbolising commitment and unity between a couple as the single stone represents the joining of two souls in marriage," the jewellery expert explains.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/facf38824260-ojani-noa-jlo.jpg><p id=eLXncjah6VJ>"This elongated shape also creates the illusion of longer, slender fingers for the wearer. &nbsp;It’s a unique choice and is historically linked to French royalty, giving it an association with creativity and a bold spirit, making it perfect for those who are looking to stand out from the crowd."</p><span class=listItemCountSelected_lkutm7w>2</span><span class=listItemCountTotal_l9geby0>6</span><h2 dir=ltr>Cris Judd</h2><p id=eNcb9SdQNh_>The 'Aint It Funny' hitmaker met Cris Judd in 2000 when he worked as a backup dancer for the music video of 'Love Don't Cost a Thing'.

"With its straight lines and clean facets, this cut of diamond provides a modern and sleek look for the wearer. The ring is another solitaire, symbolising the shared bond between husband and wife, yet the yellow gold band and white diamond pave band provide an added feeling of luxury and opulence."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/38db8cac2a0f-cris-judd-jlo.jpg><p id=eMhiWUgLDyi>Jessica estimates the ring to be worth between $100,000 and $150,000 (£80,000- £120,000).</p><span class=listItemCountSelected_lkutm7w>3</span><span class=listItemCountTotal_l9geby0>6</span><h2 dir=ltr>Ben Affleck</h2><p id=eTFXtS9EWkV>When Ben Affleck first proposed to his then-girlfriend, 'Bennifer' as they were dubbed sealed the deal with a ring more distinct from her two previous pieces.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9c41ed7be4ec-jlo-ben-2.jpg><p id=eqtgrA1gOV8>"The trilogy ring had a stunning radiant cut pink diamond at its centre, which we estimate to be approximately six carats, as well as two white diamond side stones," says Jessica. "Due to the fact that natural coloured diamonds are extremely rare, with pink being one of the rarest colours of all, we would estimate this ring to be worth between a staggering $2.5 and $3 million (£2-£2.3 million).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/018dd5b86e37-jlo-ben-ring.jpg><p id=eGYlth82Rcy>Pink diamonds are not only aesthetically striking but also deeply symbolic. "With their warm, rosy hue, pink diamonds are known for symbolising romance and love, making them an ideal choice for such a special piece of jewellery. The pink diamond in JLo’s ring was in fact so popular that it started a worldwide craze for coloured diamonds and subsequently increased the value of these stones!," Jessica reveals.</p><span class=listItemCountSelected_lkutm7w>4</span><span class=listItemCountTotal_l9geby0>6</span><h2 dir=ltr>Marc Anthony</h2><p id=ew3Lq8LHwpB>Top-selling salsa artist <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Marc Anthony</a> caught on to JLo's appreciation of a coloured diamond and thus proposed with an extravagant 8.5-carat radiant cut natural blue diamond ring.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/80c618c8f0c1-gettyimages-148021015.jpg><p id=eiy-Bt61IfJ>Jessica tells us: "The stunning blue diamond was set on a platinum band, meaning its subtle colour and sparkle is magnified through the cool metal of the band. The ring also had two sizable baguette cut diamonds on either side of the show-stopping blue diamond, only adding to its already extremely high price tag."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/54d553a2c3a7-jlo-marc-anthony-ring.jpg><p id=eWkjvayHGjx>The "hefty price tag" Jessica is referring to is a $4 million (£3 million) estimated value due to the rarity of the stone.
