It’s no secret that Tori has experienced some financial issues over the years, so it’s plausible that she is worried about money should she and her husband of 18 years, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dean McDermott</strong></a>, go through with their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>anticipated divorce</a>. The reported reassurance from Candy, 77, is a big deal, considering she and Tori were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>estranged for years</a> over Tori’s lack of inheritance from her billionaire father.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In addition to comforting Tori, Candy has reportedly been supporting Tori’s kids. “The children love their grandma because she spoils them and gives them the best treats! The children are Candy’s whole world, and she loves spending as much time with them as possible,” the insider added. Dean, 56, and Tori share <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>five children</a>:&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Liam</strong></a>, 16,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Stella</strong></a>, 15,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hattie</strong></a>, 11,&nbsp;<strong>Finn</strong>, 10, and&nbsp;<strong>Beau</strong>, 6.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tori-spelling-leaning-on-mom-candy-dean-embed11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>A second source confirmed that Candy wants to make sure Tori and her kids will be okay if a divorce does come. “Candy is helping with her divorce and referring attorneys. Candy wants to make sure the kids will be OK,” they noted.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The report comes less than a week after Tori was seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>leaving a $100-per-night hotel</a> in Los Angeles with her kids in tow. In June, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Beverly Hills, 90210</a> alum and her kids were photographed seemingly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>moving into a pal’s house</a> with sports equipment, stuffed animals, and more belongings. It is known that earlier this year, Tori was living in a rental property with her children, but they moved out after they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>caught mold-related sicknesses.&nbsp;</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tori-spelling-leaning-on-mom-candy-dean-embed21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>After years of &nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split rumors</a>, Dean confirmed he and Tori are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>going their separate ways</a> in a mid-June <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post. “It’s with great sadness and a very very heavy heart that after 18 years together and 5 amazing children, that @torispelling and I have decided to go our separate ways, and start a new journey of our own,” the actor wrote. “We will continue to work together as loving parents and guide and love our children through this difficult time.” However, he quickly deleted the head-turning post, and Tori has not commented on it. However, she was spotted wearing a shirt with the phrase,<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> “Boys Lie,”</a> written across it after the post was published.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The newest wave of split rumors comes less than 10 months after a person close to Tori and Dean claimed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>&nbsp;EXCLUSIVELY</a> that Dean was giving his all to the relationship after they almost broke up for good. “That turned out to be the wakeup call <span class=mark1x7sck7dx data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Dean</span> needed,” they revealed. “He went into overdrive trying to save his marriage <span class=marke2r6e3ppo data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>and</span>&nbsp;convince&nbsp;<span class=markuiz9pon25 data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Tori</span>&nbsp;not to pull the plug. It’s been a year of learning&nbsp;<span class=marke2r6e3ppo data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>and</span>&nbsp;working things out but it has paid off because they seem so happy together again.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BtZq2nop56tLzEpaOippdiurC5jJyYp5ypYrWmuM%2BipaBllJqur3nMnJueqp2kwbV5w6uYpplf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
