Perhaps not coincidentally, it’s been a “couple of weeks” since Taylor Swift called the 38-year-old out on Tumblr after he purchased her former label, Big Machine Records, from founder Scott Borchetta."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Amid the drama, the music manager <a href=#>posted a photo of himself</a> looking significantly older, seemingly aged through Photoshop. “Last couple of weeks have really taken a toll on me 😁,” he quipped in the caption of the Tuesday, July 16, post.</p><p>Perhaps not coincidentally, it’s been a “couple of weeks” since Taylor Swift <a href=#>called the 38-year-old out on Tumblr</a> after he purchased her former label, Big Machine Records, from founder <strong>Scott Borchetta</strong>. The deal, reported to be worth more than $300 million, gave Braun ownership of the master recordings from much of the pop star’s career so far.</p><p>“I learned about Scooter Braun’s purchase of my masters as it was announced to the world,” Swift, 29, <a href=#>wrote on Tumblr</a> on June 30. “All I could think about was the incessant, manipulative bullying I’ve received at his hands for years.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Scooter-Braun.jpg><p>In the post, the “You Need to Calm Down” singer claimed that Braun got <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> to bully her online after she <a href=#>objected to the lyrics of West’s track “Famous.”</a></p><p>“This is my worst case scenario,” she wrote. “When I left my masters in Scott’s hands, I made peace with the fact that eventually he would sell them. Never in my worst nightmares did I imagine the buyer would be Scooter. Any time Scott Borchetta has heard the words ‘Scooter Braun’ escape my lips, it was when I was either crying or trying not to. He knew what he was doing; they both did. Controlling a woman who didn’t want to be associated with them. In perpetuity. That means forever.”</p><p>Braun didn’t directly respond to the Tumblr post, but he did repost social media messages supporting him. Meanwhile, <strong>Yael Cohen</strong>, Braun’s wife, <a href=#>lashed out at Swift on Instagram</a>, writing, “Girl, who are you to talk about bullying? The world has watched you collect and drop friends like wilted flowers. … You are supposed to be a role model.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source told Us Weekly earlier this month that Braun <a href=#>“is open to having a private conversation”</a> with the 10-time Grammy winner.</p><p>“He has no intention of releasing a formal statement and blowing up the situation even more than it already has been,” the source added. “This is between Scooter and Taylor, not the world.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasm5%2Bkwaa%2BjJupmq2eYsCmscyipaCkqWK3sLfErGStmamhvLN50rCgn6xdmb%2BiucBmn5qrXZa0prCMoaCmZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
