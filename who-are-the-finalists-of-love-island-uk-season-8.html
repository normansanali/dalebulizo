That couple may or may not leave the villa with a solid relationship, but, hey, it's all for the plot. <a href=#>This season's been a little different</a>; there's a new villa, and the contestants no longer get sponsored by fast fashion companies. While we wait for the suspense of who will win (US viewers, Hulu streaming gets delayed by about two weeks), get to know this year's Love Island UK finalists.</p><h2 id=tasha-amber-ghouri><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tasha Amber Ghouri</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tasha quickly became a fan favorite as the first deaf or hard-of-hearing contestant on Love Island. She was <a href=#>born deaf and uses a cochlear implant</a> in her ears to hear. She's a 23-year-old dancer and model from Thirsk, England, who recently graduated from university. She's been coupled up with Andrew Le Page since day one, although things got rocky during Casa Amor.</p><h2 id=andrew-le-page><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Andrew Le Page</span></h2><p>Andrew's a real estate agent who grew up on the English Channel island of Guernsey. He's 27 and entered the Love Island villa on day one. He's been with Tasha for the entire season, besides one week during Casa Amor.</p><h2 id=gemma-owen><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Gemma Owen</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gemma's appearance on Love Island garnered a lot of press since her dad is the famous soccer player Michael Owen. The 19-year-old's dad did not come to the villa during parent's day; however, he's <a href=#>very proud of his daughter</a>. Gemma is a renowned horseback rider from Chester, England, who has been with Luca since week three.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="This Is The Side Of 'Love Island' That Viewers Don't Get To See">This Is The Side Of 'Love Island' That Viewers Don't Get To See</a></span></p><h2 id=luca-bish><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Luca Bish</span></h2><p>Luca's chest tattoos strangely broke the internet before the start of Love Island Season 8, with people believing they looked just like <a href=#>Harry Styles' tattoos</a>. Luca is 23 and works as a fishmonger (which also had the internet talking) in Brighton, England. He was coupled with two other girls before settling down with Gemma Owen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=davide-sanclimenti><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Davide Sanclimenti</span></h2><p>Davide is another contestant who's been at the Love Island villa since day one. He's a business owner from Manchester, England. His journey to find love on the show started out a little rocky when he stole Gemma from Liam on the second day, but he eventually coupled up with Ekin-Su in week four. If he and Ekin-Su end up winning, there's a good chance they could become the next <a href=#>Molly-Mae and Tommy</a> with their earnings.</p><h2 id=ekin-su-c-uuml-lc-uuml-lo-lu><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ekin-Su entered the villa on the third day of Love Island Season 8, causing a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> stir with the other contestants</a>. She's a 27-year-old actress from Essex, England. Instagram is a huge part of the contestants' popularity on the show. Ekin-Su was the first Islander to reach the coveted 1 million followers during the show. Davide and her have a strong relationship, making them a favorite to win the series.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Have Dom Lever And Jess Shears Done Since 'Love Island' Season 3">What Have Dom Lever And Jess Shears Done Since 'Love Island' Season 3</a></span></p><h2 id=indiyah-polack><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Indiyah Polack</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Indiyah ended up with Dami in week three of Love Island UK Season 8, although the two parted during the drama of Casa Amor. She's a model and waitress in London, England. When the parents came to the villa right before the final,<a href=#> Indiyah's mom</a> wasn't too pleased with Dami, even going as far as to call him by another contestant's name.</p><h2 id=dami-hope><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Dami Hope</span></h2><p>Dami hails from Dublin, Ireland, where he works as a senior microbiologist. The 26-year-old came to the Love Island villa on day one, dating Amber for the first two weeks before coupling up with Indiyah. He gained the reputation of the resident flirt over the season, which caused romance rumors between him and the other contestants.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="These Are The Richest 'Love Island' Stars After Leaving The Villa">These Are The Richest 'Love Island' Stars After Leaving The Villa</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmedOhnGaemaOurbXSrapmp5ZiubDCxGagrKSRo7Fuwcpmqp6Zo6S7boSO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
