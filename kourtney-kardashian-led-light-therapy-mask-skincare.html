We take skincare seriously ‘round these parts. We’re all aging at the same pace, but our skin doesn’t need to be proof of it. That’s why, day after day, we slather on toners, serums, ampoules, moisturizers and face masks after cleansing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We’re all aging at the same pace, but our skin doesn’t need to be proof of it. That’s why, day after day, we slather on toners, serums, ampoules, moisturizers and face masks after cleansing. We’ve also begun using tools to massage and contour our face over the past few years. But is it enough?</p><p>One major thing your skincare routine could be missing is some <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">LED light therapy</a>. It’s not some unattainable thing you can only get at celebrity dermatologists. You can <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy your own LED face mask</a> to wear at home, allowing you to target anything from wrinkles, to rough spots, to pores, to hyperpigmentation, to acne all with the same reusable tool. That’s what <strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong> did, and she looks like she’s practically aging backwards!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3-Color-LED-Mask-Kourtney.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Meifuly 3 Colors LED Face Mask</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$35 </a>at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, June 29, 2021, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>Kardashian recently posted a photo on Instagram wearing a Poosh-approved DMH Aesthetics LED mask. The issue? It’s $190. If only we were on the list to receive Poosh’s summer essentials bundle — it’s part of the package! According to <a href=# rel=noopener>this post </a>explaining the benefits of LED and the mask, “Kourt loves the red and blue light the most. Since she’s added this ritual to her self-care routine, it’s been life-changing for her skin.”</p><p>Life-changing? We want in. That’s why we’re adding <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this Meifuly mask</a> to our Amazon cart. It looks practically identical to Kardashian’s and it uses the same three LED colors to target different skincare concerns. The red light may actually help reduce redness, believe it or not. It may also help with inflammation and visibly large pores. The blue light could be the way to go for acne, breakouts, wrinkles and other uneven textures. Lastly, the yellow/amber light may be great for age spots, melasma and repairing sensitive skin.</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Meifuly 3 Colors LED Face Mask</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$35 </a>at Amazon!

You slip it over your ears just as you would a pair of glasses and switch it on to the color you want to use. The LED light will cover your whole face apart from your eyes, so you can watch TV or read while wearing it.
