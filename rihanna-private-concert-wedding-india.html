In the depths of my wildest dreams, I also indulge in imagining my favorite artists commemorating the milestone with a performance. Friday night, those dreams became a reality for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant, whose wedding celebration included a private show from Rihanna.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Before the lovebirds cued the wedding bells, they cued Rihanna’s Anti. Ending a yearlong hiatus from performing (her last show was the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a42845645/rihanna-super-bowl-halftime-performance-2023/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2023 Super Bowl halftime show" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>2023 Super Bowl halftime show</u></a>), the pop icon took the stage, which glowed with fluorescent blue strobe lights. “I’m here tonight in honor of Anant Ambani and Radhika,” she said to the crowd. “Thank you for having me here. God bless your union. I wish you all the best. Congratulations. How many of you believe in love? Make some noise for love!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rihanna’s 19-song set included “Bitch Better Have My Money,” “Umbrella,” “Pour It Up,” “Stay,” “Needed Me,” “We Found Love,” “Rude Boy,” “Work,” “Consideration,” and “Diamonds,” which she sang as fireworks went off overhead.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Fenty Beauty founder wore the perfect outfit to match her electric concert: a figure-hugging neon-green dress that featured long sleeves, ruching details on each hip, and a slit along her left leg that traveled up to mid-thigh and culminated in a ruffle detail, over a pair of baby-pink leggings, both of which were covered in shimmery sequins that dazzled as she swayed and spun around. At one point, the singer added a matching bubblegum-pink baseball cap, which featured layers of tulle fabric that fell down her back; at another point, she donned a traditional Indian embroidered jacket in gorgeous pink and purple jewel tones. Rihanna went barefoot for the occasion and accessorized with layers of diamond necklaces and earrings. For beauty, she opted for her usual glowy, sultry glam and styled her long locks down sleek and straight.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show took place in Jamnagar, India, and marked Rihanna’s first time performing in the country. She kicked off three-day ceremony, in which Anant—the son of Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani—married his longtime girlfriend.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d41b366c-0c5e-4fd4-85f9-ab612540d1c4_1701099318.png alt="Headshot of Christina Perrier" title="Headshot of Christina Perrier" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Christina Perrier is a NYC-based freelance writer who covers culture and lifestyle topics.
