What made fans shocked was that, in the letter, Ocean confessed that his first love was a man.</p><p>Ocean shared the post amidst the release of his debut album Channel Orange. Soon after, a drama-filled fiasco seemed to erupt as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Target refused to sell the album</a>, which many— including Ocean's then-manager Christian Clancy—<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> assumed was for reasons pertaining to his sexuality.</a> Clancy, who tweeted his feelings about Target's alleged homophobic decision, later retracted his statement, citing that the reason Target didn't carry the album was because it was released digitally first, and that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his initial response was an "emotional knee jerk reaction</a>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The letter was a ground-breaking moment in Hip hop as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">same-sex attraction/relationships had not previously been met with open arms in the genre</a>.

In his lengthy response, the singer said he wasn't trying to sell sex to his listeners and, on the letter said, "I didn't need to label it for it to have impact. Because people realize everything that I say is so relatable, because when you're talking about romantic love, both sides in all scenarios feel the same s**t." Ocean further rejected labeling himself in regard to is sexuality, stating, "You can't feel a box. You can't feel a label.
