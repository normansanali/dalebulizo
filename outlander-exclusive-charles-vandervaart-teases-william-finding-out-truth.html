" I started hitting the gym a lot more – I don't know if you've seen Sam but he's a big guy!" Charles joked. "Gotta get stronger to fill those shoes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/33109319f3ab-ols7-704-051722-0120-a.jpg><p id=eGHUScsf2PQ data-wc=65>"Sam and I talked quite a bit about the mannerisms he has in the show. I didn't want to do too many of the same because William is his own person… but William spent a lot of time with Jamie when he was younger not knowing he was his father… Jamie does this thing with his eyes, and with his little finger when he's thinking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/461ea74bfb91-ols7-704-052022-0135-a.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b822e3d0b667-ols7-701-050222-0029-a.jpg><p id=eGxpByg5Cqj data-wc=27>"We incorporated a little bit of that.

For book readers, here's more about how that meeting goes down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ba4a2628248f-william-outlander-season-7.jpg><p id=eDw8IhbVVtw data-wc=67>Charles, who hails from Canada, uses a British accent to play the adoptive son of Lord John Grey, and spoke about working on his accent. "I'm not very good at accents so I did a lot of work when I was there," he explained. "The onset dialect coach was fantastic and helped me out a lot. I'm from Canada so I'm up there now. Hello from Canada!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/19579b62b1ee-outlander-sam-and-claire.jpg><p id=eRfgfxMrgQT data-wc=55>He added: "[It] goes to show how strong William's identity is tied to the English hierarchy and the monarchy and how painful that'll be to realise his position in that whole structure is illegitimate. So when he finds out that Jamie is his dad, I don't think he's going to be too thrilled about that." &nbsp;</p><p id=eqSi-CRmFtm data-wc=12><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
