It’s as simple as that, and you should be proud of it no matter what. Does that mean you wouldn’t prefer a different look though? Not necessarily. Take cellulite, for example. Pretty much everyone has it — even supermodels — so it’s nothing to be ashamed of, but that doesn’t mean you have to pretend you’re in love with it when you’re not. And hey, if getting rid of it also means relaxing your muscles and feeling like your best self, then why not?</p><p>There are plenty of wannabe anti-cellulite creams out there, plus sketchy treatments we wouldn’t recommend, but there are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">legitimate options</a> available as well — and you don’t need to pay thousands of dollars to take advantage of them. You don’t even need to spend $25. You don’t even need to leave the house — not with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">this incredible set</a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cellulite-results.jpg><p><strong>See it! Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">New Body Life Anti-Cellulite Cups With Cellulite Massager</a> at Amazon!</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">This set </a>comes with two silicone cups — one large and one small — as well as a massaging brush. Silicone cups are favorites for flushing away toxins and smoothing out the skin, and plenty of athletes also love them for relaxing their muscles. They are often preferred over glass, as well, since they require no heat to create suction. These are hypoallergenic too, so they are a favorite of those with sensitive skin!</p><p>So, how exactly does cupping work? It’s not rocket science, so don’t worry about having to study up. First, just make sure you’re not starting with dry skin. Use cream or oil, or try it out in the shower with the water running down your skin. Gently squeeze the cup, or squeeze it a little more once you’re used to it, and simply place the opening on the skin, letting go so it can lock on!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>See it!
