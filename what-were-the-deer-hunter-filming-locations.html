And, of course, who can forget the lush, misty forests of the U.S., where the main characters engage in their favorite activity that the film was named after? Let’s take a world tour to see what some of the most prominent filming locations were from the movie.</p><h2 id=h-ohio-locations data-injectable=false>Ohio locations</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Meryl Streep in The Deer Hunter. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/glsoAm44ep</a></p>— Brock Rizy (@BEEow) <a href=#>September 6, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=739 data-current-count=1039 data-injectable=true>Though&nbsp;The Deer Hunter&nbsp;is set in Clairton, Pennsylvania, what was filmed for the movie is a hodge-podge of many different cities in the general area, including many locales in Ohio. Chief among them is the St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Cleveland, where the wedding between John Savage’s Steven and Rutanya Alda’s Angela occurs. As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Movie-Locations</a>&nbsp;noted, the church in Clevend’s Tremont district looks so authentically Moscow-like because it is supposedly “a replica of the Czar’s cathedral inside the Kremlin.” You can also find the Eagle Supermarket, where Streep’s Linda worked a few blocks west of the church, with the building repurposed for a local business, Lilly Handmade Chocolates.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Other notable locations from The Buckeye State include Lemko Hall in Cleveland, where the wedding reception scene was filmed, the saloon scene at the fictional Welsh’s Bar at Mingo Junction, and the steel mill scene filmed at U.S. Steel Central Furnaces in Loraine, as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Giggster.com</a>&nbsp;pointed out.</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=772 data-injectable=true>Despite&nbsp;The Deer Hunter&nbsp;being called out for inaccuracies in its depiction of Saigon and other aspects of the Vietnam War, in general, as it pertains to overseas, many of the movie’s scenes that take place in the U.S. were praised for their authenticity. This includes filming steel mill scenes at an actual facility and the VA hospital scene at the Louis Stokes VA Medical Center in Cleveland. Other filming locations in Ohio include Steubenville and Struthers.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Pennsylvania and West Virginia locations</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>THE DEER HUNTER (1978) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wJmjjVcgjQ</a></p>— Michael Warburton (@MichaelWarbur17) <a href=#>September 5, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Pennsylvania filming locations for&nbsp;The Deer Hunter&nbsp;include Pittsburgh and the actual city of Clairton.

In addition, the prison camp scenes were filmed on a constructed set on the famous River Kwai, the setting of the acclaimed World War II drama The Bridge on the River Kwai.</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=false>As far as the deer hunting scenes, they were mostly filmed in Washington State’s Heather Meadows in Deming.
