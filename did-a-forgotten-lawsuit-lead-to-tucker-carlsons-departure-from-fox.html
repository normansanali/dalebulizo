She sued Carlson and a number of other producers last month, as well as Fox News and its parent company Fox. Grossberg claims Fox News discriminated based on religion, disability, and gender.</p><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>She said her work environment was full of “constant bullying and gaslighting,” which caused her “so much stress and anxiety that her stomach ulcers flared up and she was in excruciating pain.”</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Grossberg started at Fox News as a senior booker for Maria Bartiromo, where she claimed male executives would call Bartiromo “crazy,” “menopausal,” “hysterical,” and a “diva.” She then moved to the head of booking and senior producer role for Tucker Carlson. The producer role, she said, was eventually <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taken away from her without her knowledge</a>.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=701 data-injectable=true>She said she was even blamed for the Dominion lawsuit against Fox because she wasn’t able to “manage” Bartiromo correctly. The stress at Carlson’s show was so great, she alleged, that she asked to take time off but was told, “We’re all under stress. This is Tucker’s tone and just the pace of the show.”</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>In the lawsuit, Grossberg describes coming in to work for Carlson on her first day and seeing “many large and blown-up photographs of Nancy Pelosi in a plunging bathing suit revealing her cleavage. The images were plastered onto her computer and elsewhere throughout the office.”</p><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>The next day, she was asked if Bartiromo was sleeping with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a question she said was wildly inappropriate and made her extremely uncomfortable. There were also “group discussions,” in which “misogynistic views of women as objects to be judged solely based on their appearance were broadcasted.”</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>The lawsuit said that no woman, regardless of occupation or political affiliation, was “safe from suddenly becoming the target of sexist, demeaning comments.”</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>For example, Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon was going to appear on the show, and the lawsuit alleges that the newsroom entered into a “crass and sexist discussion” about whether Dixon or her opponent Gretchen Whitmer was “hotter” and more desirable sexually.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>“Such disgusting remarks were never made about men appearing on Carlson’s show,” the lawsuit said. While we’re not exactly sure why Carlson got fired, it seems like this wouldn’t be left out of the reasoning.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxqrCMmmSfp6KcvLXAxKdkpZmnqMKqwIylnJqcXam8bsDUnKKeql2YrrO40qilrGWUmr2ivtOuqZ5llqe8rnnFqK9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
