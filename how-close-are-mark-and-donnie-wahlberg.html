Both have excelled in acting and in music, but with so much going on, one has to wonder just how close the bothers are these days with their thriving careers.</p><p>Let’s take a look and see just how close Mark and Donnie Wahlberg are!</p><h2 id=they-were-in-new-kids-on-the-block>They Were In New Kids On The Block</h2><p>To get a better understanding about Mark and Donnie Wahlberg and how things are now, we need to take it back to the 80s when both men were looking for their big break in Hollywood. During that time, they were both in a music group that went on to conquer the world.</p><p>In the early stages of the group, both Mark and Donnie Wahlberg were part of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New Kids on the Block</a>. The group was still piecing things together for their final lineup, and eventually, Mark would leave the group, allowing for a lineup shift that would go on to top the charts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As fans saw in the 80s and 90s, New Kids on the Block were an unstoppable machine. They sold millions of records, had toys, a hotline, and even a cartoon. Donnie was thriving in the group, but Mark had been left behind. Despite this, Donnie would soon see to it that his younger brother make a name for himself.</p><p>Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch would eventually get their chance at worldwide fame, and once the song “Good Vibrations” was released, people soon were seeing both Wahlberg brothers at the top of the charts. Just like that, both brothers were in. New Kids was way bigger than the Funky Bunch, but as we will soon see, these roles would switch when acting came into the fold.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little Known Facts About Jenny McCarthy And Donnie Wahlberg’s Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=mark-breaks-out-in-hollywood>Mark Breaks Out In Hollywood</h2><p>Mark Wahlberg was able to breakout in the music industry and in modeling after his brother had paved the way. Eventually, Mark would set his sights on acting where he would eventually blossom into one of the biggest stars in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wahlberg had plenty of steam thanks to his music and modeling, and he was beginning to turn in some solid performances in films like&nbsp;Fear and&nbsp;The Basketball Diaries. Once&nbsp;Boogie Nights took off, people quickly saw what he was capable of and started to look past his old Marky Mark persona.</p><p>Over time, he would be in massive films like&nbsp;Ted, The Departed, The Italian Job&nbsp;and more, even earning an Oscar nomination, according to&nbsp;IMDb. He was a force at the box office, and people were starting to wonder if Donnie could keep up.</p><p>Now that New Kids had fallen by the wayside, Donnie had shifted his focus to acting. In film, we have seen him in huge projects like&nbsp;The Sixth Sense, the&nbsp;Saw franchise and even in&nbsp;Zookeeper. However, he has been a fixture on television with his smash hit series&nbsp;Blue Bloods, which has aired over 200 episodes, according to&nbsp;IMDb.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s amazing to think that both brothers have found so much success in acting and in music, and it goes to show that the family has loads of talent. With this in mind, people still want to see where things are today, and we will soon see that the business is what helped them get closer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Things You Never Knew From The Set Of Mark Wahlberg’s Films</a></span></p><h2 id=wahlburgers-brings-them-back-together>Wahlburgers Brings Them Back Together</h2><p>Mark and Donnie Wahlberg have been extremely busy in the last&nbsp;year few decades, but a television series based on their restaurant franchise has been a huge bridge that brought the pair closer together.</p><p>Wahlburgers wound up being a hit show on the small screen that focused on the family as they brought their burger business to new heights, and fans got to see these two get closer, along with the rest of the clan coming together, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, Donnie would say, “Of the many, many things that have come out of this crazy journey for us as brothers, as business partners, the best part is that it’s rebuilt our family. It really meant a lot to me.”</p><p>How fitting that it was a project for the industry that got the pair closer than they had been in years. It might sound unconventional to most, but the fact that it had such a positive impact is great for the family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Donnie Wahlberg Have A Good Relationship With His Kids?</a></span></p><p>Mark and Donnie Wahlberg seem to be closer than ever, and hopefully, this will lead to some more projects for the duo.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Wahlberg’s Recent Posts Prove He’s Getting Better With Age</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLmwv8RmmKudXaKus7eMmqWdZZSku6%2B1xGaumqCcl7Kzs44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
