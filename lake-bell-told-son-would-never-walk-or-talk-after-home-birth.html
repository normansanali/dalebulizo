They cut the cord and <a href=#>[husband] <strong>Scott</strong> [<strong>Campbell</strong>]</a> ran out half naked [with Ozgood] and I was naked after my seven hours of laboring.”</p><p>The newborn spent 11 days in the NICU following his home birth. The&nbsp;Bless This Mess&nbsp;star explained, “He was hypoxic, he was without oxygen for longer than the four minutes that is associated with being okay. … We were told that he could [have] cerebral palsy or never walk or talk. That was our reality.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After this, the New York native sought therapy and was treated with medication for a year and a half to combat the guilt she felt. She went on to tattoo Ozgood’s and his 4-year-old <a href=#>sister Nova</a>‘s names on her body.</p><p>Now, the toddler is doing well. “I have this incredible little boy who rolled over at two months and walking at nine months as if to say, ‘Mom, I got this. I’m working these milestones early so you can chill the f–k out,’” Bell told Shepard, 44.</p><p>In 2016, she gushed about her daughter to Us Weekly exclusively. “She’s truly the coolest person I know,” Bell said at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGalmZuaeqOxy6VkraecmXq0u81mrqitnJl6r7HVnqlmr5GhuG670WarmqSbYq6nwMSrZKGnnZp6o7XRrZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
