I’m the oldest of three siblings, but the shortest.</p><p>3. I just celebrated my 10th anniversary [living] in NYC! I feel like I can finally call myself a New Yorker.</p><p>4. I’ve always wished I could draw. Or sing!</p><p>5. There’s a scar shaped like a key on my left middle finger from when I was 4 and curious if the stove is still hot after you turn it off. FYI, it is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rachel-Brosnahan-The-Marvelous-Mrs-Maisel-2.jpg><p>6. I have two dogs: a pit bull named Nikki and a Shiba Inu named Winston. They’re my fur children and I love them.</p><p>7. Whenever I need inspiration, I watch YouTube videos of all the Elphabas [from Wicked] singing “Defying Gravity.”</p><p>8.

My favorite form of self-care is singing at the top of my lungs in the shower and watching episodes of Survivor while snuggling my pups.</p><p>16. Sports are big in my family. Before becoming an actress, I tried my hand at basketball, snowboarding, wrestling and lacrosse.</p><p>17. Blood doesn’t make me squeamish. I used to love watching documentaries about medical mysteries, and for a minute considered becoming a surgeon.</p><p>18.

My resolution next year is to be five minutes early instead.</p><p>23. I’m a terrible cook because I get distracted and end up burning everything. I once burned spaghetti, which feels like a feat.</p><p>24. I learned to play cribbage this year and I’m obsessed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25.
