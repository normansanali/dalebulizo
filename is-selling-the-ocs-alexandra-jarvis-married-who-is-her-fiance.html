Fans of the series get the opportunity to view the top luxury properties in the area from the comfort of their homes. However, the talented group of real estate agents featured in the show makes the series what it is. Thanks to their presence, viewers can get their fill of entertaining drama that keeps them wanting more.</p><p>One such cast member is <a href=#>Alexandra Jarvis</a>, who made quite the waves through her words and actions in the premiere season. Having seen her in her element during work hours, viewers cannot help but be curious about the realtor’s personal life, specifically her dating journey.</p><h2>Alexandra Jarvis Hails From Alabama</h2><p>Alexandra Jarvis hails from Alabama and celebrates her birthday on March 1 every year. The realtor graduated summa cum laude with a Spanish and International Business degree from Auburn University. Afterward, she went on to study at UC Irvine School of Law and completed her graduation with distinction.</p><p>Alexandra then litigated business and employment law matters at a firm based out of Newport Beach, California. Her time as a practicing attorney helped her gain skills that would benefit her during her career as a real estate agent. In fact, within the first year of joining Orange County’s real estate industry, Alexandra closed approximately $40 million in sales.</p><p>Presently, Alexandra seems to be working as a realtor as well as an attorney and is also active in the modeling industry. The reality TV star seems to enjoy working in the kitchen with her partner during her free time. Though she likes to party as much as anyone, the attorney seemingly prefers water over any other drink in the world. She has even proclaimed herself as a water sommelier and can apparently tell the brand of water just by taste. Her other interests include calming walks on the California coastline.</p><p>As far as her time on ‘<a href=#>Selling the OC</a>‘ is concerned, Alexandra was initially close to her co-worker Alexandra Rose, but as of season 2, the two realtors have undoubtedly drifted apart. Furthermore, Alexandra has developed a bond with Gio Helou but does not get along with <a href=#>Polly Brindle</a>, given the latter’s open dislike for the Alabama native. The reasons behind the same are unclear and have led to some interesting confrontations throughout the show.</p><h2>Alexandra Jarvis’ Husband is a CEO</h2><p>Alexandra Jarvis is happily married to <a href=#>Sergio Ducoulombier</a>, the CEO of Slip Cash. The couple got engaged on December 25, 2020, much to the delight of the realtor, who shared the happy news on her social media. Alexandra and Sergio celebrated their third dating anniversary on June 14, 2022, and a couple of days later, the two were thrilled to ring in the latter’s birthday together. As mentioned in season 2 of the Netflix show, Alexandra did end up eloping with Sergio after over two years of being engaged.</p><p>On April 14, 2023, Alexandra and Sergio got married at Villa del Balbianello, a beautiful establishment in Italy that provides a stunning view of Lake Como. “We wanted to have a very intimate and romantic wedding day without all the traditional expectations around us,” Jarvis <a href=#>told</a> People. “So we decided let’s the two of us go to Italy. We’ve been before, and it’s actually where I told him I loved him. He had already told me he loved me, but I held back for a little while.” The couple celebrated their honeymoon in Milan, Italy, and following her marriage, Alexandra now goes by Alexandra Jarvis Ducoulombier.</p><p>Sergio appeared only briefly on Netflix’s ‘Selling the OC’; he accompanied Alexandra to the Casino Night hosted by her co-worker Gio in season 1. His presence may have been minimal on the show, yet it gave the viewers a much-wanted insight into the realtor’s personal life. That said, certain cast members do not seem to think this relationship was genuine as the pair might want others to believe, leading to several confrontations in season 2 of the show. No matter the comments made by others, Alexandra and Sergio’s relationship seems to be thriving daily, and we hope they have a happy married life ahead.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmoqtdqLKtuMinnmasmJp6sK%2FSZpilnaiWu6W%2BwGahmqqmnsBuucCrqaKdlGLEqbuMoqpmoJWneqe1wKeanmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
