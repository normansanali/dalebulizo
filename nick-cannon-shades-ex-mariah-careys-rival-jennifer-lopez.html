Shoutout to the lambs!” (Carey refers to her fans as the Lambily.)</p><p>Carey first dissed the “On the Floor” singer during a 2000s interview-turned-meme after she was asked about Lopez. “I don’t know her,” the “All I Want for Christmas Is You” songstress said with a sly smile.</p><p>The Glitter actress<a href=#> defended her comments on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in 2016.</a></p><p>“I can’t believe people still make such a big deal out of it,” Carey said. “I’m very forgetful … Apparently, apparently, I’m forgetful, because I don’t remember the fact that it was just like, ‘Hi, I’m so and so,’ and then like, ‘Hi,’ and that’s it.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added: “If I had never had a conversation with you, and someone asked me about you, I’d be like, ‘I don’t know him, but he seems cool,’ or, ‘I don’t know him.’ … I don’t know her. Like, what am I supposed to say? … It wasn’t like I don’t know who she is. Of course I do.”</p><p>This is not the first time this week Cannon has used his time guest hosting for <strong><a href=#>Wendy Williams</a></strong> to throw shade.

I’m the one who told [Pete], ‘Get you an older woman, man!’ I said that,” Cannon said. “Leave them little pop stars alone! An old woman knows what she wants. She don’t play no games!

Get you somebody older!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZOgeqStzaemp2Wjna6lsdJmnLFlnZa%2Fqq3HZpqaqpWuwG6%2ByK%2BYpWWamruvtcWeqWakn6Wyu3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
