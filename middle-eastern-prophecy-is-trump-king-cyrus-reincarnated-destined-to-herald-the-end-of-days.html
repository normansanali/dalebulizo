The final period — or dispensation — is at hand, they say. This will be the "Millennial Kingdom".</p><p>"Most evangelicals subscribe to a belief in premillennialism, the belief that the second coming of Christ will begin a 1000-year period where Christ will rule over a peaceful and prosperous Earth," doctor of religious history Neil Young told <i>Newsweek</i>.

Yet God made him king, and declared him to be "a man after my own heart".</p><p>Trump's priest Jeffress has an even more portentous parallel. He paints the controversial President's reign as similar to that of the biblical King Cyrus.</p><p>The Old Testament book of Isaiah describes Cyrus as the King of Persia and, as such, one of Israel's greatest enemies. But he was chosen by God to do his work — conquering Babylon and freeing the Jewish people.</p><p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one of Trump's most vocal international supporters, also embraces the parallel: "We remember the proclamation of the great King Cyrus the Great — Persian King. Twenty-five hundred years ago, he proclaimed that the Jewish exiles in Babylon can come back and rebuild our temple in Jerusalem ... And we remember how a few weeks ago, President Donald J. Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
